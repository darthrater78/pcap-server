# Dev Skills gate state

## Work commit: Traffic Diagram follow-ups (2026-09-17, after 1.1.0-beta.1 shipped)
Track: work commit -- no version bump requested yet for this batch.

User requests, in order: much slower playback + a "trace" of traffic as it
moves + DNS resolution as an option; separately, source/destination right-click
filter should offer the directional (src/dst) field, not just ip.addr; edges
should brighten/widen the more a link is crossed, capped; DNS resolution must
be a toggle decided before a diagram loads, not mid-view; a guard for the
Sequence Diagram's own wrong-shape case (too many hosts); node clicks need a
confirm before navigating away; README needs a beta-announcement convention.

Changes: backend/packet_parser.py + main.py (resolve_names on
GET .../conversations, mirrors the existing get_packet_list opt-in via the
same _name_resolution_args); frontend/js/diagrams.js (EDGE_HEAT_CAP=12
cumulative per-link brighten/widen during playback, recomputed from scratch
each frame rather than tracked incrementally so scrubbing backward stays
correct; SEQUENCE_LANE_CAP=40 host guard, same block-not-truncate treatment as
the existing caps; speed control extended to 0.02x; resolve_names read once
from the page's existing #resolve-names toggle, not a new control, since it
must be set before either diagram's fetch runs; confirm() before a node click
navigates, matching tls.js's removeCertificate precedent); frontend/index.html
(speed <option>s); frontend/js/app.js (col-src/col-dst right-click now offers
the directional field first, generic ip.addr kept as a second option rather
than dropped); docs/viewer.md + docs/operating.md + README.md (beta-announce
block, explicitly self-deleting on the next stable release -- see the HTML
comment in README.md above it).

🔨 BUILD      ✅ handoff offered, user declined to try it -- full suite: 1581
              passed (up from 1575: 7 new browser tests, net +6 after one
              rename), 322.10s, real tshark/chromium. docker build ->
              localhost/pcap-server:traffic-diagram-followups; smoke-run
              (scratch /tmp/pcap-smoke, MASTER_KEY_FILE set): encryption
              enabled, 0 tracebacks, / 200, /js/diagrams.js 200 (served
              content confirmed to carry EDGE_HEAT_CAP/SEQUENCE_LANE_CAP),
              /api/auth/status 200. Left running on :18080; user said "go
              ahead" -- container and scratch dir cleaned up after.
🔒 SECURITY   ✅ 0 Critical, 0 High. resolve_names reuses the already-reviewed
              _name_resolution_args opt-in (no new resolver behavior, same
              off-by-default privacy stance). Directional filter field comes
              from a fixed 3-value set (addressField's return), never from raw
              user text as a field name. confirm() shows plain text, no HTML
              rendering, no injection surface. No new dependency.
📄 DOCS       ✅ docs/viewer.md updated (confirm dialog, trace speed, edge
              heat, resolve-names timing, lane cap); README's beta block
              added with its own removal instruction inline.
📦 RELEASE    ⏳ Committed eb7b44b and pushed to new branch
              `traffic-diagram-followups` -- `main` had no branch left on it
              (PR #12's --delete-branch removed `claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf`),
              and the working tree was sitting directly on `main`'s checkout,
              so a branch was created first rather than committing to main
              directly. PR #13 open: traffic-diagram-followups -> main
              (https://github.com/darthrater78/pcap-server/pull/13). No
              version bump / release notes approval requested yet for this
              batch -- user asked to "open" the PR, not to ship it.
🚀 SHIP       ⬜ not requested yet for this batch

## Release sequence: 1.1.0-beta.1 (2026-09-17)
Track changed mid-session: work commit -> release sequence. User wants this
shipped as a beta image on GHCR. release.yml only builds/publishes on a tag
push (on: push: tags: 'v*') and its gate job hard-requires the tagged commit
to be on main (compare/<sha>...main) -- so "no tag" and "stay off main" were
both raised and both resolved: tag it (release.yml already treats any
-beta/-rc suffix as a prerelease -- no :latest/:dev movement, all existing
safety checks still apply), and merge to main via PR first, then tag.
Previous track's SECURITY/BUILD work below still stands; this section covers
the version bump and the rest of the release gates.

🔢 VERSION    ✅ 1.1.0-beta.1 (minor bump: new feature, non-breaking; beta.1:
              first beta). backend/main.py APP_VERSION (source of truth --
              release_notes_url derives from it), docker-compose.yml image tag,
              CHANGELOG.md entry. Deliberately NOT bumped: README's Quick Start
              link and docs/reverse-proxy.md's example image tags, both pinned
              to v1.0.0 on purpose -- a beta must not become the default path
              for new/general users, matching release.yml's own choice not to
              move :latest for a -beta tag. docs/operating.md's version table
              gained a row explaining -beta/-rc tags carry no floating tag
              (first time this project has cut one). Previous version (1.0.0)
              confirmed tagged on remote -- not blocked.
📄 DOCS       ✅ CHANGELOG entry added; README (features bullet + viewer.md
              pointer) and docs/viewer.md (new "Traffic Diagram and Sequence
              Diagram" section, cap policy stated) updated for the new views;
              docs/operating.md's tag table covers the new -beta case.
🔨 BUILD      ✅ re-ran full suite post version-bump: `scripts/check.sh` (all
              tests) — 1575 passed, 0 failed, 337.90s, real tshark/capinfos/
              chromium. Confirms nothing hardcodes the old version string.
📦 RELEASE    ⬜ next: commit approval, then PR into main
🚀 SHIP       ✅ tag v1.1.0-beta.1 pushed (user's own machine), points at
              ed4ba63 (matches merge commit). release.yml run 35259858102:
              success. Verified: tag on remote ✅ | image published ✅
              (ghcr.io/darthrater78/pcap-server:1.1.0-beta.1, confirmed from
              the run's own build-push log, no GitHub Release step needed
              beyond what release.yml does automatically for a tag push) |
              PR #12 merged ✅. User's first pull attempt used the git tag's
              `v` prefix on the image name by mistake (image tags strip it,
              same as 1.0.0) -- corrected, not a publish problem.

## Work commit: Traffic Diagram + Sequence Diagram (2026-09-17)
Track: work commit (frontend-only feature, no version bump, no backend change).
Plan approved via plan mode: /home/serveradmin/.claude-steve/plans/shimmering-gathering-quilt.md.

New: frontend/js/diagrams.js (topology force-graph + sequence swimlanes, vanilla
JS/SVG/Canvas, no new dependency), tests/browser/test_diagrams_ui.py (6 new
Playwright tests). Edited: frontend/index.html (2 buttons + 2 dialogs + script
tag), frontend/css/style.css (--diagram-cat-1/2/3 + --diagram-other palette
slots, .stats-dialog--large, diagram/legend/lane styling). No backend changes
— both diagrams reuse the existing /conversations and /packets routes.

🔢 VERSION    ⬜ not owed — work commit, no release
🔨 BUILD      ✅ `scripts/check.sh tests/browser/ tests/test_browser_suite_hygiene.py`
              — 182 passed (incl. the 6 new diagram tests), 304.84s, real
              chromium. Manual click-through against a real capture NOT done
              this session (would need the full docker/encryption/auth setup);
              flagged to the user rather than skipped silently.
🔒 SECURITY   ✅ 0 Critical, 0 High. All rendered text via escHtml/.textContent
              (no innerHTML of unescaped data); no new endpoints, no new
              dependency, no CSP change; node/packet volume capped (200 hosts /
              5000 packets) and blocking rather than truncating, so no new DoS
              surface; filter-building reuses existing sanitized
              buildFieldFilter/addressField. Quality: no deep nesting, no
              N+1s; force layout is O(n^2) per iteration but n<=200 by the cap.

## Session opened 2026-09-17 (dev-skills v2.24.0, local — user confirmed)
Track: none yet — no work started this session.
Environment corrected from prior session's "remote container" note: user
confirmed this is a persistent local box (hostname dev-server), same clone as
their terminal. Git commands will be presented for the user to run, not
executed directly, going forward. Shell: Linux Terminal (bash/zsh).
Branch claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf still 1 commit ahead of origin (2a66f86,
unpushed). All release tags present on remote through v1.0.0 (verified via
ls-remote). PR #11 merged. No unfinished release detected.
Note: .claude/dev-skills-gates.md is tracked in git (not gitignored) from the
prior remote-container session's convention — flagged for the user, not
changed unilaterally.

## Release sequence 1.0.0 — first stable release (opened 2026-09-17)
Track: release sequence (version bump + PR into main + tag v1.0.0).
User: "pr into main". Default branch confirmed `main` via gh repo view.
Head branch: claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf (main is at d04dd4a, strictly behind).
release.yml: tag commit must be on main AND have a passing Check run.

🔢 VERSION    ✅ 1.0.0 in all six refs: backend/main.py:116, docker-compose.yml
              image, docs/reverse-proxy.md x2, README compose link (blob/v1.0.0),
              docs/operating.md version table (+ :latest row, :dev note).
              release_notes_url derives from APP_VERSION. Previous v0.1.0-dev.40
              tagged on remote (ls-remote). No test pins the version literal.
🔨 BUILD      ✅ check.sh 1559 passed + image smoke-tested; handoff offered, user declined to try it
              (replied "commit and push" without trying localhost/pcap-server:1.0.0).
              check.sh EXIT=0: 1559 passed, 0 skipped (tshark, capinfos, chromium), 308s,
              on e249870's tree. docker build -> localhost/pcap-server:1.0.0
              (sha256:7b98898d69..). Hardened run: running, 0 restarts, "encryption
              enabled", index 200, APP_VERSION 1.0.0 in image.
              ebc8d7f (release.yml version gate + tests/test_release_workflow.py +
              CHANGELOG) adds no app code: tests/test_release_workflow.py 10 passed,
              with test_main.py 78 passed. The step's gh api call was run against the
              real repo: d04dd4a -> REFUSE, e249870 -> PASS. actionlint not on this
              box; Lint workflows runs it in CI on the push.
🔒 SECURITY   ✅ Code diff since d04dd4a: APP_VERSION literal only. Compose: image tag
              only (settings otherwise identical). pip-audit -r backend/requirements.txt:
              No known vulnerabilities. Dependabot alerts API reachable, 0 open;
              .github/dependabot.yml present. 0 Critical / 0 High / 0 Medium / 0 Low.
              Quality: no code structure changed; nothing to review.
              ebc8d7f release.yml step: gate job only (contents: read, actions: read),
              no new action, no new permission. Tag/ref/sha reach the script through env,
              never ${{ }} in run text. Fails closed on API error (pipefail), on a missing
              APP_VERSION line, and on any mismatch. The test runs the script with a stub
              gh; no network. 0 Critical / 0 High.
📄 DOCS       ✅ CHANGELOG 1.0.0 entry (highlights, bugs squashed, upgrading, changes
              since dev.40). operating.md version table: 1.0.0, :latest, :dev caveat.
              No stale dev/pre-release wording in README/docs.
📦 RELEASE    ✅ e249870 + ebc8d7f committed and pushed (user: "commit and push", then "do all
              steps", which covers the recovery plan: delete release, version gate, PR, merge;
              release notes = CHANGELOG 1.0.0, approved with "do all steps").
              PR #11 claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf -> main opened. Check (push) on ebc8d7f
              run 35239177483 success 9m50s; Lint workflows success x2.
🚀 SHIP       ✅ SHIPPED 2026-09-17 (after recovery). Four post-ship checks:
               * tag v1.0.0 -> d583f8f (merge of PR #11), pushed by the user after Check
                 35240408302 passed on d583f8f. Earlier bad tag on d04dd4a deleted by user.
               * Release run 35241890972 success. Gate ran all three checks incl. the new
                 "Require the tag to match APP_VERSION" (success). GitHub release v1.0.0,
                 Latest, not prerelease, 15:42:34Z; approved CHANGELOG 1.0.0 notes applied
                 via gh release edit (6494 chars). Bad earlier release deleted.
               * PR #11 MERGED (merge commit d583f8f).
               * ghcr :1.0.0 == :latest == sha256:c686ea5a.. (replaces bad 96afdffe..).
                 Pulled: /app/backend/main.py APP_VERSION = "1.0.0". Hardened run of the
                 published image: running, 0 restarts, 0 tracebacks, encryption enabled,
                 index 200. :dev untouched (stays 0.1.0-dev.40, by design).
              HISTORY: v1.0.0 first pushed on d04dd4a before merge; run 35238625314
              published dev.40 code as :1.0.0/:latest before cancel landed. Recovered via
              release delete, tag delete, version gate (ebc8d7f), PR merge, re-tag.
              RELEASE SEQUENCE 1.0.0 CLOSED AND SHIPPED.

## WORK COMMIT — README/compose simplification (2026-09-17)
Track: WORK COMMIT (docs + compose comments only, no version bump, no tag, no publish).
Scope: README.md cut to a tour (870→282 lines) with detail moved to new
docs/viewer.md, docs/sanitizing.md, docs/development.md and to
docs/operating.md (Installing), docs/target-hosts.md (fingerprints),
docs/filters.md (badges, saved filters). docker-compose.yml reordered: setup
steps, then a comment-free block to paste into compose.yaml, then all
explanation. Docs now say compose.yaml for the user's own file.
Commit approval: user said "commit" (2026-09-17).

🔒 SECURITY   ✅ Prose/comments only. `docker compose config` of HEAD's compose
                file vs the new one: IDENTICAL resolved config (no setting
                added, removed or changed). Diff grepped for credentials,
                private keys, tokens, eval/shell=True, curl|sh: 0 hits.
                0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium, 0 Low. No manifest touched.
                Relative links/anchors across README + docs: 0 broken.
                tests/test_entrypoint.py 7 passed.
VERSION / BUILD / DOCS / RELEASE / SHIP: ⬜ not owed on this track.
Note: README links docker-compose.yml at tag v0.1.0-dev.40, which shows the
old layout until the next release is tagged.

## WORK COMMIT — setup docs restructure (2026-09-17)
Track: WORK COMMIT (docs only, no version bump, no artifact, no publish).
Scope: README.md Quick Start + docs/operating.md + docker-compose.yml's own
header comments, restructured on the user's direction: a one-paste setup
block leads docker-compose.yml (matching a block the user tested directly
against the live compose file), the compose file and the data directory are
documented as independent locations, README's Quick Start now points at that
block instead of duplicating it, and a troubleshooting row documents a
cosmetic `secret ... not found` message (confirmed by a read-only Explore
agent to originate from Compose's own secret-mount timing, not from
backend/*.py or entrypoint.sh — details in the gate line below). Not part of the
in-flight RELEASE SEQUENCE 0.1.0-dev.40 below, which has other, unrelated
uncommitted files (backend/main.py, CI workflows, tests, CHANGELOG.md,
docs/architecture.md) this commit does not touch or stage.
Commit approval: user said "commit and push" (2026-09-17), after reviewing
each doc edit made in this conversation.

🔒 SECURITY   ✅ Diff is comments/prose only (markdown + YAML `#` comments) —
                no source file, route, dependency, or schema changed. Grepped
                the staged diff for password/secret/token/api-key/private-key
                patterns and shell/eval/exec markers: every hit is the literal
                word "secret" used in its documentation sense (the master-key
                file, the Compose `secrets:` block) or a path like
                `secrets/master.key` — no credential value, no real secret
                material. 0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium, 0 Low.
                Dependencies: unchanged (no manifest touched) — audit not
                re-run, nothing to audit.
                Quality: N/A — no code structure/performance patterns apply
                to a comments-only diff.
VERSION / BUILD / DOCS / RELEASE / SHIP: not owed on this track (Section 2).

## RELEASE SEQUENCE 0.1.0-dev.40 — hardening (opened 2026-09-17, dev-skills 2.23.0)
Track: RELEASE SEQUENCE (version bump plus tag).
User: "stay on opus, adopt all, go with that scope". Opus is approved for this task.
DECISION (adopted from 2.23.0): what makes something a release is intent to
publish (a bump, tag or artifact). A push to claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf
(which is the remote default) without a bump is a WORK COMMIT. This replaces
the older rule that "any merge to the canonical branch is a release". No PRs
before 1.0 still stands (the Gate 5 PR is N/A).
Hook: .claude/hooks/gate-preflight.sh (upstream v2.23.0, read in full), wired
into .claude/settings.json under PreToolUse.
Start: 1a316df. Scope: buildx v4; release.yml tag-on-default-branch check,
concurrency, timeouts and persist-credentials; SHA pins in check.yml and
lint-workflows.yml; _connect trust-before-key; compose hardening.
NOT MINE, found in the tree mid-session: README install steps and the compose
header comments were rewritten (the data dir is decoupled from where the
compose file lives). Treated as the user's; included in dev.40 pending their OK.

🔢 VERSION    ✅ 0.1.0-dev.40 in all seven refs (main.py:116, compose image,
              reverse-proxy x2, README install curl / version table / upgrade
              curl). v0.1.0-dev.39 is tagged on the remote. release_notes_url is
              derived from APP_VERSION.
🔨 BUILD      ✅ check.sh EXIT=0, 1559 passed / 0 skipped (349s), on the code as it
              will be committed. Since then only comments/docs changed
              (compose header, README, CHANGELOG); test_entrypoint.py (reads
              compose) 7 passed; actionlint clean. Image
              localhost/pcap-server:0.1.0-dev.40 built. Hardened compose run for
              real (CapEff=0, NoNewPrivs=1, RO rootfs, rekey/resetmfa/tls OK,
              mounts owned by root/1000/1001 boot). The fixed one-paste block also
              ran for real from a separate compose dir: running, encryption
              enabled. handoff offered, user declined to try it (AskUserQuestion:
              "Skip trying it").
🔒 SECURITY   ✅ 0 Critical / 0 High, in code and dependencies. pip-audit clean;
              Dependabot alerts and security updates enabled by the user, 0 alerts
              (SBOM has 22 packages). SHAs checked in two places. Medium items
              ACCEPTED by the user (AskUserQuestion): DAC_OVERRIDE kept, apt
              unpinned, no osv-scanner. Quality: _connect restructure keeps the
              finally cleanup; no new nesting/duplication.
📄 DOCS       ✅ CHANGELOG dev.40 (Security / CI / Documentation / Internal).
              security.md hardening, architecture.md _connect order. The user's
              commit 2e458b9 (setup untangle) and the README move to the top (the
              user said include it) are covered in CHANGELOG Documentation. FIXED:
              the compose one-paste block cd'd into the data dir and then ran
              `docker compose up -d` there, which fails because the README puts the
              compose file elsewhere; it now uses absolute paths and was tested.
              Every version ref is dev.40: README 18/107/123, compose,
              reverse-proxy x2, main.py.
📦 RELEASE    ✅ PR ➖ N/A (no PRs pre-1.0). Commit d04dd4a approved and pushed; release notes approved ("yes").
🚀 SHIP       ✅ user pushed v0.1.0-dev.40 -> d04dd4a (verified with ls-remote). Release run

              Check d04dd4a) both passed; buildx v4 and persist-credentials:false worked.
              Release published as a prerelease, "v0.1.0-dev.40 (Dev)", with the approved
              notes applied. Image :0.1.0-dev.40 and :dev share digest 2c094523...; the
              in-image APP_VERSION is 0.1.0-dev.40. The compose file at the tag was fetched
              from raw (200) and run as published (hardened): running, / 200,
              auth/status 200, servers 401, CapEff=0, 0 tracebacks. No PR (N/A).

## RELEASE SEQUENCE 0.1.0-dev.39 — the Dependabot batch (2026-09-16)
Track: RELEASE SEQUENCE -- merging into the canonical branch counts as a release (SKILL.md 2).
User: "Dev 38 was pushed" (live box REDEPLOYED to dev.38 -- carried item closed),
"Merge #4 and #10, then batch the rest". Plan chosen via AskUserQuestion:
one release dev.39, commit A = local merge of #4 + #10, commit B = the other
eight, one push after every gate. Pushing the merges marks all ten PRs merged.
Opus approved for this task.
Env: same box as dev.38 ("Local CLI, remote"); gh logged in as darthrater78.
Claude EXECUTES git after approval; tag pushes go to the user (5.8).
Start: caf2737 (= v0.1.0-dev.38), 0 ahead / 0 behind, tree clean.
METHOD: all ten diffs applied UNCOMMITTED so the gates test the exact final
tree. The real merges are done at commit time, and the final tree is diffed
against this one (it must be identical).
Only conflict: the uvicorn and starlette lines are adjacent in requirements.txt;
resolved by taking both bumps.

SCOPE WIDENED (user, 2026-09-16): "yes, roll them into dev.39" -- the pins
Dependabot had not opened yet (5-PR limit): uvicorn 0.52.4->0.53.0, pydantic
2.10.3->2.13.5, pyotp 2.9.0->2.10.0, playwright 1.62.0->1.63.0. pydantic-settings
turned out to be UNUSED (never imported); the user chose "Remove it" -> dropped
from requirements.txt. check.sh/README said pydantic-core has no cp314 wheel --
no longer true for the new pin; the wording now says the 3.13 ceiling holds until
the suite runs on 3.14 (none on this box, so the ceiling is NOT raised).
The first suite pass below covered the ten-PR tree only; it was re-run after
this change (/tmp/dev39-check2.log) in a venv with pydantic-settings uninstalled.
uvicorn/starlette now live at github.com/Kludex/* -- the original 2017 repo,
transferred to its maintainer, and PyPI's project_urls agree. Not a hijack.

🔢 VERSION    ✅ 0.1.0-dev.39 in all seven refs (backend/main.py:116,
              docker-compose.yml:107, README 231/332/348, reverse-proxy
              117/372). v0.1.0-dev.38 -> caf2737 is on the remote.
🔨 BUILD      ✅ FINAL TREE: check.sh EXIT=0, 1556 passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped
              (306s), venv without pydantic-settings, chromium v1243 for
              playwright 1.63. Image rebuilt (BUILD_EXIT=0) and booted: / 200 in
              2s, app.js 200, auth/status 200, servers 401, ssh-keys 401,
              paste 403, login 401, 0 tracebacks; in-image uvicorn 0.53.0,
              pydantic 2.13.5, pyotp 2.10.0, pydantic-settings ABSENT.
              FIRST PASS (ten-PR tree): 1556 passed (309s;
              dev.38 took 308s, so the slow start was the concurrent docker build).
              2 NEW WARNINGS, both raised inside starlette 1.6's own test client
              (test-only): "httpx with starlette.testclient is deprecated;
              install httpx2", and anyio's BlockingPortal alias. httpx2 is a new
              package -- vet it before adopting; not done in this release.
              CONTAINER ✅ localhost/pcap-server:0.1.0-dev.39 builds. Booted with
              a throwaway PCAP_MASTER_KEY: / = 200 in 2s; app.js 200;
              auth/status 200; servers 401; login 401; ssh-keys/paste 403
              (plain-HTTP refusal, as in dev.38); 0 tracebacks. In-image
              versions: uvicorn 0.52.4, starlette 1.6.0, aiofiles 25.1.0,
              qrcode 8.2, fastapi 0.141.1. (Without a key the image REFUSES TO
              START, which is correct.)
🔒 SECURITY   ✅ 0 Critical / 0 High / 0 Medium -- signed off by the user.
              pip-audit (final pins): no known vulns in requirements.txt or -dev.txt.
              Quality: no app code changed; check.sh edit is comment + one echo
              string (bash -n clean).
              New action SHAs match their tags in BOTH git ls-remote and the
              API: checkout 3d3c42e5 v7.0.1, login dbcb8138 v4.6.0,
              build-push 53b7df96 v7.3.0, gh-release efb35369 v3.0.3.
              Breaking changes in those majors: Node 24 runtime (hosted
              runners fine); build-push removed the DOCKER_BUILD_* env vars and
              setup-python removed the pip-install input -- neither is used.
              uvicorn API used by serve.py/tls manager (Config ssl_* fields,
              load(), Server.should_exit) checked present in 0.52.4.
              check.yml/lint-workflows still use floating tags (@v7) -- the
              existing Low finding, unchanged in kind.
📄 DOCS       ✅ CHANGELOG dev.39 (Changed/Removed/Documentation/Internal),
              rewritten for the widened scope. README + check.sh no longer claim
              pydantic-core lacks cp314. No doc mentions any old dep/action
              version or pydantic-settings (grepped).
📦 RELEASE    ✅ synced (0/0). Both commits approved by the user ("yes, commit
              and push both"). PR ➖ N/A -- no PRs before 1.0; branch canonical.
   PUSHED 2026-09-16: caf2737..b4cd983 (78f713b = #4+#10, b4cd983 = the other
   8 + release). All ten dependabot heads verified ancestors; GitHub shows
   PRs #1-#10 MERGED. Final tree == tested tree except this file's sign-off
   lines. Lint workflows run 35080273648 success; Check 35080273790 running.
   Check 35080273790 on b4cd983: success (setup-python@v7, checkout@v7 fine).
   Container restart mid-watch killed the watcher only; state intact.
🚀 SHIP       ✅ SHIPPED 2026-09-16. User said "ship", approved the notes, and ran
              the tag block from /home/serveradmin/pcap-server (never executed
              here, SKILL.md 5.8). Four post-ship checks, all verified:
               * tag v0.1.0-dev.39 on the remote -> b4cd983, the commit Check
                 passed on.
               * Release run 35082550885 success -- first run of login-action
                 v4.6.0, build-push v7.3.0, gh-release v3.0.3, checkout v7.0.1.
               * GitHub release published 10:01:25Z, prerelease, approved notes
                 applied with gh release edit. 0 file assets -- as every release;
                 the artifact is the image.
               * PRs #1-#10 MERGED.
               * ghcr.io/darthrater78/pcap-server:0.1.0-dev.39 PULLED and checked:
                 APP_VERSION 0.1.0-dev.39, uvicorn 0.53.0, starlette 1.6.0,
                 pydantic 2.13.5, pyotp 2.10.0, pydantic-settings absent.

### FOLLOW-UPS out of dev.39
 * docker/setup-buildx-action is still v3.12.0 (Node 20). The release run warns
   "forced to run on Node.js 24". Most likely the next Dependabot PR, queued
   behind the 5-PR limit.
 * httpx2: starlette 1.6's test client wants it. It's a new package; vet it first.
 * Python 3.14: pydantic-core now has cp314 wheels. The ceiling could rise once
   the suite has run on 3.14 (none on this box).
 * Still open from earlier: the _connect order (for dev.39 -> now dev.40), M5 / L1 / M1-code,
   and the workflow audit findings (tag-on-branch check, concurrency, timeouts,
   persist-credentials, floating tags in check.yml and lint-workflows.yml).


## RELEASE SEQUENCE 0.1.0-dev.38 — the add-server host-key flow
Track: RELEASE SEQUENCE (user-facing behaviour change). Scope chosen by the user
via AskUserQuestion: "Roll it all in" PLUS the paste-to-compare modal, then the
SSH-key paste added mid-flight on their "I also want the private SSH key to be
pasteable and not just uploaded".

Env: the system prompt says managed remote container; the working tree carried a
LOCAL session's files. Put to the user, who answered "Local CLI, remote" -- read
as their own box reached remotely. Claude EXECUTES git after approval (the
container-reclaim risk makes a presented block the losing bet either way), which
is also what dev.34/35/37 did on the user's explicit instruction.
Model: Opus 5, above the Sonnet ceiling. Flagged twice; user chose the task
rather than switching down, consistent with every prior release.

🔢 VERSION    ✅ 0.1.0-dev.38 in all seven refs (backend/main.py:116,
              docker-compose.yml:107, README 231/332/348, reverse-proxy
              117/372). v0.1.0-dev.37 confirmed on the remote -> d513564.
              REPO_URL + release_notes_url present.
🔨 BUILD      ✅ ./scripts/check.sh EXIT=0, 1556 passed / 0 failed (308s).
              dev.37's baseline was 1532, so +24 are this change's.
              Run THREE times: after the feature, after the quality refactor,
              after the doc/comment sweep. Green each time.
              CONTAINER: localhost/pcap-server:0.1.0-dev.38 builds (641MB);
              boots, / and /js/app.js = 200, 0 tracebacks. Served app.js carries
              withHostKeys/openHostKeyDialog/refreshServerDetailState/
              normaliseFingerprint/adminPasteKey and ZERO scan-accept-keys.
              Served index.html carries the dialog + paste UI. The VALIDATOR was
              exercised in the image's own interpreter: real key accepted, public
              key and passphrase-protected key both refused by name.
              Both new routes answer 403 unauthenticated over plain HTTP -- the
              read-only middleware firing BEFORE auth, which is the right answer
              for a route carrying a private key.
🔒 SECURITY   ✅ 0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium. pip-audit: no known
              vulnerabilities; NO new dependency (asyncssh already present, so
              requirements.txt and Dockerfile are untouched).
              THE POINT: the one surface that renders hostile input does it
              without innerHTML at all. A key_type and fingerprint come from
              whatever answered on that address -- the exact input not to trust,
              on the screen deciding whether to trust it. renderHostKeyRows uses
              createElement + textContent throughout. Every other new innerHTML
              site (5, all checked) interpolates escHtml'd values or constants.
              Private key handling: never logged (main.py logs name + byte count
              only); all 5 PrivateKeyRejected messages name the failure kind and
              never the bytes; paste refused over plain HTTP with the
              key-specific reason; rides the existing 128KB cap via
              startswith("/api/admin/ssh-keys"); model caps the field at 64KB;
              stays ADMIN-ONLY like the upload -- deliberately NOT widened,
              because the key store is shared by every server.
              Authorisation otherwise unchanged. trust-host keeps both bounds
              (endpoint-matched, refuses to REPLACE trust); only its 409 wording
              changed, to stop sending people to an admin when deleting their own
              last server at that endpoint does it.
              DELIBERATE BREAKING CHANGE, flagged not buried: add_server 400 ->
              409 and host_not_trusted -> host_keys_required. One condition, one
              code -- that unification is what lets withHostKeys be a single
              handler. Anything outside the UI keying on the old status/code
              breaks. Pre-1.0; the CHANGELOG says so in terms.
              QUALITY, fixed during the gate not deferred: openHostKeyDialog was
              83 lines doing three jobs -> renderHostKeyRows (26) /
              wireFingerprintCompare (17) / orchestrator (35). addServer 63->52,
              saveServerEdit 51->32. And a comment that LIED (adminPasteKey
              claimed the textarea was cleared on failure too; it is not) --
              corrected the comment, not the code, because wiping it on a 409
              name collision forces a full re-paste and buys nothing once the key
              has crossed the wire.
              NOTED, NOT CHANGED: _connect parses OUR client key before checking
              whether the TARGET is trusted. Ingest validation makes an
              unparseable stored key much harder to create now, so the order was
              left alone rather than widen this diff. For dev.39.
📄 DOCS       ✅ CHANGELOG dev.38 (Changed/Fixed/Documentation/Internal), with
              the breaking API change called out explicitly. README's
              add-a-server walkthrough rewritten around the new flow, plus
              paste-to-compare and pasting an SSH key. architecture.md:
              withHostKeys keeping the server authoritative on trust, the single
              host_keys_required contract, the edit-path refcount.
              operating.md: pasting a key and the two mistakes caught at ingest.
              STALE-REFERENCE SWEEP: five comments in app.js, main.py, models.py
              and test_ssh_manager.py described "Scan & accept host key" as the
              CURRENT mechanism -- all corrected. The only surviving mention is
              the deliberate historical note explaining why there are now three
              buttons. _host_not_trusted_error renamed _from_host_not_trusted,
              since it now emits a differently-named code.
📦 RELEASE    ✅ commit caf2737, pushed. PR ➖ N/A -- no PRs before 1.0
              (memory release-process), branch canonical.
              Diff: 17 files, +1505/-257. No keys, .env or capture data staged.
🚀 SHIP       ✅ SHIPPED (user-driven tag). Verified 2026-09-16: tag
              v0.1.0-dev.38 -> caf2737 on the remote; release published
              2026-09-16T00:49:43Z (prerelease); Release workflow success.

### WHAT THIS RELEASE DOES, against what the user asked for
User: "audit the entire add server process... clunky... still have issues with
the key hosts", then "fully review the add server flow with the host keys...
Check all iterations of the process to find flaws", with the design stated
outright: "any of the action buttons should ask for the host keys and then store
them ephemeral until the user adds", plus "when the key is forgotton the trust
icon on the server page does not change", plus "I also want the private SSH key
to be pasteable and not just uploaded".
 1. withHostKeys: Test connection / Check prerequisites / Add server all gather
    keys on demand, held in pendingAddKeys, pinned for good only by Add. The
    separate Scan & accept button is DELETED -- nothing left for it to do.
 2. The trust/never-checked pills refresh in place (refreshServerDetailState),
    from all five paths that change them. Root cause was that selectServer wrote
    them once and nothing ever redrew them; the worst case was Check
    prerequisites reporting success under a pill still reading "Never checked".
 3. The fingerprint review is a real <dialog> with monospace fingerprints, copy
    buttons, and a paste-to-compare box that ignores the SHA256: prefix and
    spacing.
 4. update_server refcount-forgets the endpoint it leaves (the orphan factory).
 5. The edit form offers to trust a newly-pointed-at address.
 6. SSH keys can be pasted; both routes now validate at ingest.

### TWO TEST FIXTURES WERE HIDING COVERAGE (found during Gate 2)
 * tests/browser/conftest.py wrote the literal string "# placeholder for tests;
   not a key" as browser-test-key, on the reasoning that only the file's
   PRESENCE is checked. True of add_server, false of anything that connects:
   _connect loads the client key BEFORE consulting the trust store, so every
   probe became a generic 502 "SSH connection failed" and the 409 the add form
   branches on could never be observed. A test for that branch was impossible.
 * clean_slate reset servers and usernames but NOT known_hosts, so a host one
   test trusted was one the next test never got asked about.
Both fixed. The browser suite got FASTER (152s -> 132s) because the probe now
fails fast on 409 instead of attempting a real connection to TEST-NET-3.


## ADD-SERVER / HOST-KEY AUDIT — 2026-09-15, asked for by the user
"audit the entire add server process... clunky... still have issues with the
key hosts" then "fully review the add server flow with the host keys... Check
all iterations of the process to find flaws."

USER'S TARGET DESIGN, stated by them, not inferred:
 "Before clicking add on the server, ANY of the action buttons should ask for
  the host keys and then store them ephemeral until the user adds."
So Test connection and Check prerequisites must gather keys the same way Add
does, hold them client-side, and only Add persists. Backend ALREADY supports
this (_transient_host_keys, main.py:1405, pins-probes-forgets; pendingAddKeys,
app.js:1036, is already the endpoint-keyed ephemeral slot). The gap is entirely
in the frontend: probeTest/probePrereq never gather.

USER-REPORTED BUG, reproduced and root-caused:
 "when the key is forgotten the trust icon on the server page does not change"
ROOT CAUSE: the detail pane's header pills (app.js:783-794) are WRITE-ONCE.
selectServer draws them on click; nothing redraws them. Three symptoms:
  a) Admin -> Known hosts Forget/Delete/Purge call loadAdminKnownHosts() ONLY.
     loadServers() is never called (app.js:6002, 5952, 6008) -> activeServers
     keeps a stale host_trusted.
  b) List -> Trust host DOES call loadServers() (app.js:759) -- pill still
     stale, because the pane is not redrawn.
  c) Detail -> Check prerequisites calls loadServers() then refreshes ONLY
     #server-os (app.js:862-866), under a comment saying a full re-render
     "would throw away the results just drawn above it". Intent right, scope
     too narrow: Check prerequisites is the very action that flips verified
     false->true, so the fix reports success and the pane still reads
     "Never checked".
FIX SHAPE: a targeted renderServerDetailPills(srv) touching the header + the
blocked-why banner only (preserving what that comment protects), plus
loadServers() on the three admin handlers.

EVERY ITERATION, trust asked for or not (verified by reading each handler):
 1 Add form / Add server        ✅ prompts (POST->400->scan->confirm->POST)
 2 Add form / Test connection   ❌ fails host_not_trusted, tells you to press #4
 3 Add form / Check prereqs     ❌ same
 4 Add form / Scan & accept     ✅ explicit -- REDUNDANT with #1
 5 Edit form / Save changes     ❌ NO key step at all. New endpoint silently
                                   untrusted; old endpoint's keys ORPHANED
 6 Detail / Test connection     ❌ bare "Failed: msg" (app.js:1332), no hint,
                                   inconsistent with #2 which does hint
 7 Detail / Check prerequisites ❌ bare error
 8 Detail / Start capture       ❌ refused
 9 List row / Trust host        ✅ prompts, but pill stale after (b above)
10 Admin / Known hosts          ✅ works, never refreshes the Servers tab

OTHER FLAWS FOUND (all verified in source, none fixed yet):
 * EDIT ORPHANS KEYS. update_server (main.py:1586) never refcounts the endpoint
   it left. remove_server (main.py:1492) is the ONLY caller of
   count_servers_for_endpoint. Repoint host1->host2 and host1's keys stay
   pinned with nothing referencing them -- the exact orphan class the dev.36
   Admin purge button exists to mop up, manufactured by the edit path. No test
   covers it (grepped tests/).
 * TWO ERROR CODES FOR ONE CONDITION: add_server raises host_keys_required,
   the probes raise host_not_trusted. Every caller must know both.
 * STALE "✓ accepted" LINE. scanAcceptKeys writes #host-key-status
   (app.js:1042). There is NO listener on new-srv-host / new-srv-port --
   checked every reference. Edit the host after accepting and acceptedKeysFor
   (app.js:1038) correctly drops the keys (endpoint-keyed) while the green
   "✓ accepted for old:22" stays on screen. Add then re-scans and re-prompts,
   reading as a failed accept.
 * FINGERPRINT REVIEW IS window.confirm() (app.js:5907). The one decision in
   the product that needs a human to compare 43 base64 chars, in an
   unstyleable proportional-font dialog that cannot be made monospace, cannot
   be copied out of, and blocks the page so the host cannot be consulted. If
   every action button now routes through it (the user's design), it gets
   pressed MORE -- so it wants to become a real in-page modal: monospace, copy
   button, paste-the-expected-value box that diffs.
 * FOUR PEER BUTTONS, NO ORDER (app.js:1012-1019). Only Add is btn-primary.
   The user's design collapses this to three in a real order and deletes #4.
 * 409 ON trust-host (main.py:1333) tells the user "an admin has to forget the
   old keys". If theirs is the ONLY server at that endpoint, deleting it
   forgets them via the refcount -- self-service exists and the message hides
   it. Common case on a rebuilt host.
 * ONE MACHINE, TWO TRUST RECORDS: known_hosts is UNIQUE(hostname, port), so
   foo.local:22 and 192.168.1.5:22 are separate decisions for one box.
   Inherent to the design and defensible; nothing in the UI hints at it.

SOUND, checked and NOT a finding: the no-orphan invariant in add_server's
finally (main.py:1258); kernel_verified_at / os_name / self_target_reason all
correctly cleared on endpoint change (database.py:631-640); trust-host being
endpoint-matched and refusing to REPLACE trust; pinning what was on screen
rather than a re-scan. The clunkiness is in the seams, not the design.

## Session opened 2026-09-15 #5 — WORK COMMIT: CI bundle M2/M3/M4
Track: WORK COMMIT (no APP_VERSION bump, no artifact, no tag). Required by
SKILL.md S2: 🔒 SECURITY on the changed code + commit approval. VERSION / BUILD
/ DOCS / RELEASE / SHIP stay ⬜ -- not owed on this track, not skipped.
Scope chosen by the user (AskUserQuestion): the CI bundle held out of dev.37
because it edits the pipeline that ships releases.
 - M2: the 5 actions in release.yml pinned to commit SHAs, version comments kept.
 - M3: `permissions: contents: read` on check.yml's test job.
 - M4: github-actions + pip ecosystems added to .github/dependabot.yml.

NOT app CHANGELOG material (CI plumbing), same call as the dev-33/34 CI commits.

State re-derived from evidence (SKILL.md S2), not trusted from the entry below:
 - HEAD = d513564, branch claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf, 0 ahead / 0 behind
   origin after `git fetch`. `git ls-remote --heads origin` -> that branch only.
 - APP_VERSION (backend/main.py:113) = 0.1.0-dev.37; `git ls-remote --tags
   origin` -> contiguous through v0.1.0-dev.37, which points at d513564, the
   HEAD commit. Released == tagged == source version: NO unfinished Gate 6
   (GATE_REFERENCE step 7). dev.37 really did ship.
 - Working tree carries the dev.37 ship record (this file, modified) and the
   untracked .claude/dev37-handoff.md. No source file modified.

ENVIRONMENT DIFFERS from every prior entry. This session's system prompt
describes a MANAGED REMOTE EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT (cloud container, repo cloned
at session start, reclaimed on end) -- every entry below says LOCAL CLI. The
signals are mixed: the paths and the two uncommitted files are the local
session's, so this was put to the user rather than assumed (GATE_REFERENCE
step 0: "If the signals are ambiguous, ask -- do not assume local").
 - If REMOTE: Claude executes git after approval; this file is committed to the
   branch; GitHub ops go through the GitHub MCP tools (deferred in this
   session); the two uncommitted files above are DESTROYED unless pushed.
 - If LOCAL: Claude presents git blocks, the user runs them (S5.8), as dev.34-37.
`/usr/bin/gh` exists on this box, but this session's system prompt states gh has
no access here -- so GitHub MCP is the assumed path until gh is proven working.

Local dev workflow: ./scripts/check.sh. CI build check: check.yml (calls
./scripts/check.sh -- no drift). CI release: release.yml on `v*` tag push, with
the dev.36 `gate` job in front of it. Plus lint-workflows.yml.
hooks/gate-preflight.sh still NOT installed (.claude/hooks has session-start.sh
only) -> the prose pre-flight is the only enforcement.
No PRs before 1.0 (memory release-process): Gate 5's PR step is ➖ N/A by the
user's standing decision; the working branch is canonical and the tag push
drives the release.

Model: Opus 5, above the Sonnet ceiling. Flagged to the user at session start;
no task approval yet this session (the dev.37 approval was task-scoped).

CARRIED FORWARD from the dev37 handoff, still open:
 1. CI bundle M2/M3/M4 -- SHA-pin the 5 actions in release.yml, add
    `permissions: contents: read` to check.yml, add github-actions + pip to
    .github/dependabot.yml. Work commit, no version bump. M4 open since
    2026-09-14.
 2. Redeploy :0.1.0-dev.37 on the live box (user's action) -- H1 is only fixed
    in the image, the running container is still dev.36.
 3. Deferred by design: M5 (TOTP secrets plaintext at rest), L1 (chunked-body
    cap), M1-code (limiter re-key).

🔢 VERSION    ⬜ not owed -- work commit, APP_VERSION stays 0.1.0-dev.37
🔨 BUILD      ⬜ not owed. The equivalent ran anyway: actionlint 1.7.12
              (downloaded + sha256 verified against lint-workflows.yml's own
              pinned checksum, which therefore re-verified too) EXIT=0 over all
              three workflows, and yaml.safe_load parses all four files. That is
              exactly what CI runs for a workflow-only change -- check.yml's
              paths-ignore excludes .github/workflows/**, so this push fires
              Lint workflows ONLY and no Check run. Deliberate, and the reason
              release.yml's gate has a workflow_dispatch escape hatch.
              ./scripts/check.sh not run: no Python/JS touched, and no test in
              tests/ reads workflow or dependabot files (grepped).

### SECURITY scan of the M2/M3/M4 diff -- 0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium
 * The 5 SHAs were resolved and then CONFIRMED FROM TWO INDEPENDENT SOURCES
   before being written: `git ls-remote --tags` against each action repo, and
   GET /repos/<a>/commits/<tag> on the API. Both agree on all five, and on
   actions/setup-python@v5.6.0 which was resolved for the audit below but NOT
   pinned (out of the chosen scope). Annotated tags were dereferenced with
   ^{} so each pin is a COMMIT sha, not a tag-object sha.
   checkout 11d5960a v4.4.0 | setup-buildx 8d2750c6 v3.12.0 |
   login-action c94ce9fb v3.7.0 | build-push 10e90e36 v6.19.2 |
   action-gh-release 3bb12739 v2.6.2
 * M3 cannot break check.yml: the job checks out, apt-installs, pip-installs
   and runs ./scripts/check.sh. Nothing in it writes to the repo, pushes, or
   touches packages. Narrowing to contents:read is a no-op if the repo default
   was already restrictive and the fix if it was not.
 * M4 adds no execution surface -- dependabot opens PRs, it does not run this
   repo's code. pip directory is /backend, where requirements.txt and
   requirements-dev.txt actually live; the root pyproject.toml is pytest config
   with no dependencies, so a `/` entry would watch nothing.
 * No secrets added, moved or echoed. No `run:` block changed at all.
 * pip-audit over backend/requirements.txt: no known vulnerabilities (the
   baseline dependabot's new pip entry starts from). Deps unchanged this commit.

### WORKFLOW AUDIT (WORKFLOW_REFERENCE.md checklist) -- findings BEYOND the
### chosen scope. Reported, deliberately NOT fixed unilaterally.
release.yml  ✅ SHAs pinned (M2) ✅ least-privilege per job ✅ set -euo pipefail
             ✅ secrets only in env: ✅ dependabot (M4)
             ⚠️ no `persist-credentials: false` on checkout
             ⚠️ no concurrency group (a release must use cancel-in-progress:
                false -- never cancel one in flight)
             ⚠️ no timeout-minutes on either job (the gate's own 1800s deadline
                is not a job timeout)
             🚨 no tag-on-default-branch verification: any tag on any commit
                publishes. Applicable here -- the canonical branch is the only
                head on the remote and tags are pushed at its head, so the
                check would pass today and would stop a tag on an unreviewed
                commit tomorrow.
             💡 generate_release_notes: true, then the CHANGELOG notes get
                applied by hand with `gh release edit` EVERY release (dev.34,
                .35, .37 all record doing it). Extracting the CHANGELOG section
                in the workflow would end that chore.
check.yml    ✅ calls ./scripts/check.sh (no CI/local drift) ✅ permissions (M3)
             ⚠️ no persist-credentials: false ⚠️ no concurrency ⚠️ no timeout
             💡 actions/checkout@v4 + actions/setup-python@v5 still float.
                First-party, so Low by the checklist -- but release.yml's gate
                TRUSTS this workflow's conclusion, which makes a compromised
                step here a way to make a red commit look green.
lint-workflows.yml ✅ permissions ✅ checksum-verified pinned download
             ⚠️ no persist-credentials: false ⚠️ no concurrency ⚠️ no timeout
             💡 checkout@v4 floats

## Session opened 2026-09-15 #4 — RELEASE SEQUENCE 0.1.0-dev.37
Track: release sequence. Scope decided by the user ("roll it all in", pre-1.0):
the audit's code findings + the host-key add-flow bug reported live.
 - H1: unauthenticated login memory-exhaustion -> scrypt concurrency gate
   (auth.py _scrypt_gate + async wrappers; all 5 call sites in main.py;
   PCAP_SCRYPT_CONCURRENCY; mem_limit note in compose). Verified: 40 concurrent
   logins held flat vs 1.14 GB unbounded; peak scales with the gate not cores.
 - H2: bootstrap-registration race -> db.create_first_user atomic INSERT..SELECT
   ..WHERE NOT EXISTS. Verified: 8 concurrent bootstraps -> 1 admin.
 - L7: version disclosed to password-only session -> gated on totp_confirmed.
 - L2: Cache-Control: no-store on /api/ responses. L6: crypto assert -> raise.
 - Host-key bug: 'Scan & accept host key' button holds keys client-side; probe
   endpoints take ServerProbe + pin-then-rollback (_transient_host_keys); stale
   admin-only _connect message -> HostNotTrusted + host_not_trusted code.
   Verified in-container + on loopback + real github.com:22 scan; no orphan.
 - CI bundle M2/M3/M4 deliberately NOT in this commit (they edit release.yml,
   which ships this release) -- separate work commit after.

Env: LOCAL CLI -> Claude PRESENTS git commands, the user runs them (S5.8).
sudo -n docker works this session (smoke ran directly, not via paste).
Model: Opus 4.8 (session flipped from Opus 5 mid-work), above the Sonnet
ceiling; user approved staying above it for this audit+fix task.

🔢 VERSION    ✅ 0.1.0-dev.37 in all seven refs (main.py:113, compose:107,
              README 231/332/348, reverse-proxy 117/372). Prev v0.1.0-dev.36
              tagged on the remote. REPO_URL + release_notes_url present.
🔨 BUILD      ✅ ./scripts/check.sh EXIT=0, 1532 passed (279s) -- clean full run
              after fixing one stale test (ssh_manager message assertion).
              Container: image localhost/pcap-server:0.1.0-dev.37 builds (641MB);
              boots, / = 200, 0 tracebacks; authenticated version reads

              unauth (L7) confirmed in the real image; served app.js carries the
              scan-accept feature (8 hits); plain-HTTP mutating POSTs correctly
              403 (read-only middleware intact).
🔒 SECURITY   ✅ 0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium. Shown to the user. pip-audit: no
              new deps. Diff grep clean (new innerHTML all escHtml/constant; the
              one backend assert REMOVED by L6; all remaining asserts in tests).
              No-orphan invariant preserved in the transient-pin path (tested).
              AWAITING USER SIGN-OFF on the review.
📄 DOCS       ✅ CHANGELOG dev.37 (Security/Fixed), README add-flow step 3,
              architecture.md "Probing before the row exists".
📦 RELEASE    ✅ commit d513564 (user), pushed. 17 files, +587/-52. PR ➖ N/A

## Session opened 2026-09-15 #3 — dev.36, running the dev36 handoff
Track: RELEASE SEQUENCE 0.1.0-dev.36 (scope decided below; all four handoff
items). RESUMED 2026-09-15 after a usage limit cut the session off mid-work --
the tracker below was stale and said "no source file touched", which the
working tree contradicted. Re-derived from the diff, not from memory.

State re-derived from evidence (SKILL.md S2), not carried over on trust:
 - HEAD = e9075ba, branch claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf, clean working tree.
 - v0.1.0-dev.35 IS on the remote -> 2916f09 (HEAD~1, the release commit).
   e9075ba on top is the .claude/ handoff + ship record only, no source.
   APP_VERSION (backend/main.py:106) reads 0.1.0-dev.35 and agrees with all
   the other refs (docker-compose.yml:107, README.md:231/332/348,
   docs/reverse-proxy.md:117/372). Released == tagged == source version:
   NO unfinished Gate 6 (GATE_REFERENCE step 7).
 - `git ls-remote --tags origin`: contiguous through v0.1.0-dev.35.
 - `git ls-remote --heads origin`: claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf only.

Env: LOCAL CLI -> Claude PRESENTS git commands, the user runs them (S5.8).
Shell: zsh (Linux Terminal). Remote: https://github.com/darthrater78/pcap-server
Local dev workflow: ./scripts/check.sh. CI build check: check.yml (calls
./scripts/check.sh -- no drift). CI release: release.yml on `v*` tag push.
Plus lint-workflows.yml. gate-preflight.sh still NOT installed (.claude/hooks
has session-start.sh only) -> the prose pre-flight is the only enforcement.
gh IS installed here (/usr/bin/gh). No PRs before 1.0 (memory release-process),
so Gate 5's PR step is N/A by the user's standing decision; the working branch
is canonical and the tag push drives the release.

Model: Opus 5, above the Sonnet ceiling. Flagged to the user at session start;
user approved with "opus" (2026-09-15). Task-scoped to dev.36, as every prior
release has been.

🔢 VERSION    ✅ 0.1.0-dev.36 in all seven refs: backend/main.py:107,
              docker-compose.yml:107, README.md:231/332/348,
              docs/reverse-proxy.md:117/372. Prior version tagged:
              `git ls-remote --tags origin v0.1.0-dev.35` -> 2916f09.
              v0.1.0-dev.36 does NOT exist on the remote yet.
              REPO_URL + release_notes_url present (main.py:108/626).
🔨 BUILD      ✅ ./scripts/check.sh EXIT=0, 1522 passed / 0 failed
              (279s). The browser failures seen before the cut were the
              add flow changing under the suite; fixed in the tests, not
              worked around -- test_server_form.py now drives the real
              scan-and-accept path and the suite HALVED (545s -> 258s)
              because of the connect_timeout fix.
              Image: `sudo docker build -t localhost/pcap-server:0.1.0-dev.36 .`
              EXIT=0. Smoke-tested in the REAL image, not asserted:
               * bare `docker run` with NO DATA_DIR/CAPTURES_DIR/
                 SSH_KEYS_DIR -> HTTP / = 200 in 2s, /app/data/
                 pcap-server.db owned by appuser. THAT IS THE dev.34 BUG,
                 reproduced as fixed.
               * DATA_DIR bind-mounted 0500 root -> container exits 1 with
                 "refusing to start", naming the dir and `chown -R 1000:1000`.
               * ssh-keys mounted :ro -> chown failure REPORTED with its
                 real cause ("Read-only file system"), probe warns, app
                 still starts. Non-fatal on purpose.
               * UPGRADE PATH against the real shipped ghcr dev.35 image:
                 booted dev.35 on a fresh volume, inserted a dev.35-era
                 server row, booted dev.36 on the same volume ->
                 kernel_verified_at added, cutoff written
                 (2026-09-15T17:48:47Z), legacy row added_at < cutoff so it
                 is GRANDFATHERED and keeps capturing. The regression this
                 release could most easily have shipped, checked directly.
🔒 SECURITY   ✅ pip-audit over backend/requirements.txt: no known
              vulnerabilities; requirements unchanged this release.
              Dangerous-pattern grep over the diff: one innerHTML hit
              (app.js purge button) -- interpolates only orphans.length,
              a number; every host value in that table goes through
              escHtml. All new SQL parameterised. node --check app.js OK.
              Findings shown to the user (see SECURITY REVIEW below).
              0 Critical, 0 High.
📦 RELEASE    ✅ branch synced (`git fetch` -> 0 ahead / 0 behind origin),
              diff reviewed and shown, release notes = the CHANGELOG
              0.1.0-dev.36 entry, approved by the user. Commit approved
              2026-09-15 with "commit"; block PRESENTED for the user to
              run, per S5.8 (local session).
              (PR step ➖ N/A -- no PRs before 1.0, standing decision)
🚀 SHIP       ✅ user pushed the tag 2026-09-15. All four post-ship checks:
                 * tag v0.1.0-dev.36 on the remote -> e8591ba, the exact
                   commit Check passed on.
                 * GitHub release published: "v0.1.0-dev.36 (Dev)",
                   prerelease, 2026-09-15T18:17:49Z.
                 * PR merged ➖ N/A -- no PRs before 1.0 (standing
                   decision), working branch is canonical.
                 * ghcr :0.1.0-dev.36 and :dev share one digest,
                   sha256:9db99982c4e94b04f78e3516825a7deec1d40b544d5daa7e
                   d50ab34c31b5f554; :0.1.0-dev.35 is a DIFFERENT digest,
                   so the floating tag really moved forward.

              ITEM 2 PROVED IN PRODUCTION, which is the only place it could
              be. Release run 35006378207: the `gate` job ran FIRST, took
              2s, and logged "Check passed for e8591bac..." (job 104507039845
              line 88) before `release` was allowed to build. The awkwardness
              flagged at the start -- that the pipeline being changed is the
              one shipping the change -- resolved green on the first try.
              Dry-run beforehand against the real SHA predicted PASS, and it
              did.
              Trigger fix still holds: the tag push fired Release ONLY. No
              duplicate Check, no Lint. Same as dev.35, now with a second
              job in front of it.

              RELEASE SEQUENCE 0.1.0-dev.36 CLOSED AND SHIPPED.

### SECURITY REVIEW of the dev.36 diff -- shown to the user 2026-09-15
Deliberate authorisation widening, NOT a finding, but the thing to look at
hardest in this release:
 * POST /api/host-keys/scan is now any signed-in user, not admin. It is
   non-mutating by construction, so calling it cannot change what this install
   trusts. It does spawn ssh-keyscan against a caller-chosen address ->
   rate limited on the packets-per-min budget (host_scan_rate_limiter), which
   is NEW protection this path did not have as an admin route.
 * It is NOT a new class of exposure: /api/probe/test (main.py:1587) already
   took an arbitrary hostname from any signed-in user and connected to it, so
   the "is this host:port open" oracle predates this change. Checked rather
   than assumed.
 * POST /api/servers/{id}/trust-host is owner-scoped AND endpoint-matched AND
   409s on an endpoint that already has keys. It establishes trust where there
   is none and never replaces it -- without that last rule a non-admin could
   add a server at an endpoint an admin trusts, re-pin keys of their own, and
   MITM the admin's connections to it.

KNOWN LIMITATION, accepted, written down rather than hidden:
 * Two concurrent adds for the same untrusted endpoint can have one roll back
   the other's freshly pinned keys (forget_known_host is endpoint-wide). The
   result is a server showing "Host not trusted" that has to be trusted again
   -- it FAILS CLOSED, and it cannot destroy an existing admin decision,
   because keys are only ever pinned when the endpoint had none.

Quality: add_server is ~50 lines with the try/finally carrying the invariant,
which is the clearest place for it. addServer() in app.js was extracted into
scanAndAcceptForAdd() rather than growing a third nested try. No N+1, no new
unbounded caches, no blocking I/O on the loop (the probe is awaited).

### CORRECTION made after the resume, to docs written before it
The CHANGELOG and docs/security.md claimed a host that "cannot be reached"
leaves its keys rolled back. That became FALSE when the unreachable path was
finished: keys are kept iff a ROW is created, and an unreachable host that was
scanned successfully DOES get a row. Both corrected to state the real
invariant. The architecture.md check table also gained the capture-start
"has anything ever checked this?" row and an add/edit split.

### WHAT IS ALREADY BUILT (uncommitted at resume) -- all four items
Item 1 entrypoint.sh: path defaults, non-silent chown, gosu write probe per
directory, fatal on DATA_DIR only. tests/test_entrypoint.py is new (206 lines).
Item 2 release.yml: a `gate` job the release job `needs`, asking the API for
check.yml's conclusion on ${{ github.sha }}, waiting on an in-progress run with
a 1800s deadline. check.yml gained workflow_dispatch as the escape hatch for a
docs-only commit that paths-ignore skips.
Item 3 add flow: POST /api/host-keys/scan (non-admin twin of the admin scan,
rate limited on host_scan_rate_limiter), ServerCreate.host_keys +
add_unverified, add_server pins -> probes -> creates with a `finally` that
rolls the keys back unless the row was created, POST /api/servers/{id}/
trust-host for existing rows (owner-scoped, refuses an endpoint that already
has keys). tests/test_server_add_flow.py is new (529 lines).
Item 4 delete: db.count_servers_for_endpoint (cross-user by design),
remove_server forgets the keys at zero, purgeOrphanedHosts() + the orphan
callout in Admin -> Known hosts.
Also in scope, beyond the four: kernel_verified_at column + migration +
kernel_verify_enforced_from grandfather cutoff, _require_kernel_checked on
capture start, HOST_ADDRESSES in localnet, asyncssh connect_timeout,
extra_hosts host-gateway in docker-compose.yml.

### Handoff step 1 — the orphan query CANNOT be run from here
.claude/dev36-handoff.md item 4 opens with a `sudo docker exec <container>`
query against the live install. This machine is NOT that install:
 - `sudo docker ps -a` lists one exited `hello-world` and nothing else.
 - /opt/docker/pcapserver/data (docker-compose.yml's DATA_DIR bind source)
   does not exist.
So the evidence behind item 3's inherited-trust report has to come from the
user running the query on the box that actually runs the container. Presented
to them; NOT assumed either way. Do not record item 4 as confirmed-live until
that output comes back.

### DECIDED BY THE USER 2026-09-15 (AskUserQuestion) — dev.36 scope + the three open questions
SCOPE: **all four handoff items** in one release.
 1. entrypoint.sh silent-failure fix (+ its first test).
 2. release.yml gated on Check. NOTE: this reverses the 2026-09-13 DECLINED
    entry further down this file ("do not raise again"). The user was shown
    the item and chose it, so the decline is SUPERSEDED, not ignored. The
    awkwardness is real: the pipeline being changed is the one that ships the
    change, so the gate is only truly proven on the dev.36 tag push itself.
 3. Accept-fingerprints-before-create add flow.
 4. Reference-counted host-key cleanup on delete.

Q1 orphan keys: **always roll back unless the row is created.** Freshly scanned
keys persist ONLY when a server row exists. No per-path nuance -- an abandoned
form, a refused self-target and a host that is simply down all discard. A retry
after a transient failure means re-accepting the fingerprints; the user took
that cost for the clean invariant. This is STRICTER than the handoff's
suggestion and it means item 3 creates no orphans at all by design.

Q2 authorisation: **accepting fingerprints for your own server becomes a
non-admin capability.** Adding a server stays available to every user. This is
a deliberate authorisation WIDENING -- trust stops being admin-owned for the
add path. Admin -> Known Hosts stays admin-only. Must be called out in the
CHANGELOG and docs as a security-relevant change, not buried as a UX tweak.

Q3 delete: **A + B.** Forget the keys when NO remaining server row from ANY
user references that (hostname, port) -- a cross-user refcount, which
list_active_servers (per-user) cannot answer today -- AND surface pre-existing
orphans in Admin -> Known hosts with a purge action. Accepted trade: the last
server for an endpoint may be a non-admin's, and deleting it revokes an
admin's trust decision.

## Session opened 2026-09-15 #2 (local CLI, Debian 13, zsh, dev-skills 2.18.0)
Skill loaded as a REGISTERED skill this time (it is in the session skill list),
unlike the previous session which had to read SKILL.md by hand. Self-check: all
five reference files present in ~/.claude/skills/dev-skills/.

State re-derived from evidence (SKILL.md S2), not trusted from the entry below:
 - HEAD = 62cf182, branch claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf, 0 ahead / 0 behind
   origin after `git fetch`.
 - v0.1.0-dev.34 IS on the remote -> 62cf182, the exact HEAD commit. APP_VERSION
   (backend/main.py:100) reads 0.1.0-dev.34 and agrees with all seven refs.
   Released version == tagged version == HEAD: NO unfinished Gate 6, nothing
   stranded (GATE_REFERENCE step 7).
 - `git ls-remote --tags origin`: v0.1.0-dev.15 .. v0.1.0-dev.34, contiguous.
 - Working tree carries ONE modified file: this one (the dev.34 ship record,
   +48/-3, uncommitted). No source file touched this session yet.

Env: LOCAL CLI -> Claude PRESENTS git commands, the user runs them (S5.8).
Shell: zsh (Linux Terminal). Remote: https://github.com/darthrater78/pcap-server
Local dev workflow: ./scripts/check.sh. CI build check: check.yml (branches-only
push + pull_request, and it CALLS ./scripts/check.sh -- no CI/local drift).
CI release: release.yml on `v*` tag push. Plus lint-workflows.yml (actionlint).
gate-preflight.sh still NOT installed (.claude/hooks has only session-start.sh),
so the prose pre-flight is the only enforcement. This file remains tracked in
git rather than gitignored -- as the repo has always had it, not changed
unilaterally.

Model: Opus 5, above the Sonnet ceiling. Flagged to the user at session start;
no task approval yet this session (the dev.34 approval was task-scoped).

CARRIED FORWARD, still open: the lint-workflows.yml trigger defect logged for
dev.35 (see "Known defect" below) is CONFIRMED still present at HEAD -- `on:
push:` with a `paths:` filter and no `branches:` filter, so it still fires on
tag pushes.

Model approval: user said "opus is fine" (2026-09-15) for THIS task, after the
ceiling was flagged. Task-scoped, as every prior release has been.

## TASK — actively prevent capturing the box pcap-server runs on
User: "we really need to actively prevent captures to the same box the container
is installed on. major security issue."

WHAT ALREADY EXISTS (found before proposing anything, not rebuilt):
backend/localnet.py + _reject_self_target (main.py:1026), wired into add server
(1076), edit server (1166), probe test (1227), probe prereq-check (1242). It
refuses loopback, container-owned addresses, the default gateway and Docker's
host aliases with a 400 {"code":"self_capture"}, and app.js:56 turns that into
showBlockingAlert. So this is closing holes in a real guard, not adding a
missing one.

THE TWO HOLES:
 1. POST /api/captures (main.py:1529) never re-checks -- it does
    _require_server() then capture_manager.start(). A row added before the
    guard existed, or a hostname whose DNS answer has since moved to the host,
    captures with no check at all. The guard is add-time only.
 2. A bridged container cannot see its host's LAN address, which is exactly
    what a person types. localnet.py's docstring admits it and
    tests/test_localnet.py:114 ASSERTS the current behaviour
    (describe_if_local(host_lan_address) == ""). app.js's SELF_CAPTURE_WARNING
    tells the user this in prose because detection could not do it.

DECIDED WITH THE USER (AskUserQuestion, all three recommended options taken):
 - strictness: HARD BLOCK, no env override.
 - detection: shared-kernel boot_id probe over SSH *plus* a capture-start
   re-check. Containers share the host kernel, so an identical
   /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id proves the target IS this box regardless of
   network topology -- LAN IP, alias, VPN, macvlan all covered, which no
   address heuristic can do. World-readable (mode 444), no privilege needed.
 - existing rows: refuse on next use AND flag in the server list with the
   reason; do not delete anyone's configuration.

MUST VERIFY EMPIRICALLY, NOT ASSUME (this repo's standing practice): that a
container on this host actually reports the host's boot_id rather than a
virtualised one. Docker's default masked-paths list does not cover boot_id, but
gVisor/lxcfs-style runtimes virtualise /proc. If it were virtualised the probe
would silently never fire -- fail-open, so no false refusals, but no protection
either. Host boot_id read for the comparison:
70612579-dfd6-4521-a99b-5959f2ba5760. docker needs sudo in this session again,
so this goes to the user as a paste-able one-liner, as dev.34's smoke run did.

DESIGN NOTE, deliberate: the probe is a POSITIVE identification test. An
unreadable or absent boot_id (a BSD target, a masked /proc) proves nothing and
must not refuse -- absence of proof is not proof of locality, and failing closed
there would break every legitimate non-Linux target. The address checks still
apply underneath. This matches localnet.py's existing stance: "says what it
found rather than claiming more than it knows."

Track: RELEASE SEQUENCE 0.1.0-dev.35, chosen by the user via AskUserQuestion
(work commit was offered as the alternative). Same question swept in the
lint-workflows.yml trigger defect logged below, on the user's "yes, fix it
here".

IMPLEMENTATION DONE (uncommitted):
- localnet.py: BOOT_ID_PATH, _BOOT_ID_RE, BOOT_ID_MAX_CHARS, normalise_boot_id,
  own_boot_id (read each call, NOT cached -- a cached "" from an early call
  would disable the check for the process's life, silently and totally),
  describe_if_same_kernel, SelfCaptureRefused. Module docstring rewritten
  around the two layers.
- ssh_manager.py: BOOTID added to _PREREQ_SCRIPT + parsed through
  normalise_boot_id; read_boot_id(conn) helper; test_connection reports
  boot_id; run_tcpdump refuses BEFORE create_process on the very connection
  tcpdump would have used, and closes it.
- database.py: active_servers.self_target_reason + migration + setter; cleared
  on endpoint change via the same CASE pattern os_name uses.
- models.py: ServerInfo.self_target_reason (server-set; ServerAuth has no such
  field, so a client cannot clear it through the form -- tested).
- main.py: _refuse_self_target (one builder, because app.js keys off the code),
  _record_self_target, _reject_self_kernel; wired into prereq-check, test,
  both /api/probe routes, and START_CAPTURE, which had no check at all before.
  SelfCaptureRefused from the manager -> 400, recorded, not a 500.
- frontend: server-list flag (.server-warn-self, .self-target) + CSS; the Add
  form's standing warning no longer claims the LAN address cannot be detected.

🔢 VERSION    ✅ 0.1.0-dev.35 in all seven refs: backend/main.py:106,
                docker-compose.yml:107, README.md:231/332/348,
                docs/reverse-proxy.md:117/372. REPO_URL + release_notes_url
                (derived from APP_VERSION) present. v0.1.0-dev.34 confirmed on
                the remote -> 62cf182, so the previous release did ship.
🔨 BUILD      ✅ ./scripts/check.sh: 1477 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 216s,
                exit 0. dev.34's baseline was 1424, so +53 are this change's
                (one more added after, during Gate 3: the recovery-path test).
                CONTAINER (user ran scratchpad/smoke35.sh under sudo; docker
                needs sudo in this session again, as in dev.34):
                 * THE CLAIM THE WHOLE DESIGN RESTS ON IS VERIFIED, NOT
                   ASSUMED: the app image run on this host reports boot id
                   70612579-dfd6-4521-a99b-5959f2ba5760 -- byte-identical to
                   the host's. Docker does not virtualise
                   /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id here, so the shared-kernel
                   check CAN fire. Had this come back NO MATCH the mechanism
                   would have needed replacing, not shipping.
                 * own_boot_id() in the image's own interpreter returns that
                   value; describe_if_same_kernel returns the finding for it
                   and '' for a made-up id.
                 * image builds; / and /js/app.js 200; /api/servers 401
                   unauthenticated; served app.js carries the new code
                   (self_target_reason x4, "same kernel" x1); 0 tracebacks.
                 * MIGRATION verified BOTH ways, after my first attempt proved
                   nothing: the script queried pcap.db, but main.py:200 names
                   it pcap-server.db, so sqlite created an empty file and the
                   PRAGMA returned [] with no error. Re-checked against the
                   container's REAL database: fresh DB carries
                   self_target_reason. Then wound a copy back to the dev.34
                   schema (DROP COLUMN) with a populated server row and opened
                   it with Database(): column added, existing row intact,
                   os_name preserved, new column defaults to '', setter works.
                 * /api/version 404 in the log is my script guessing a route
                   that does not exist -- not a defect.
🔒 SECURITY   ✅ 0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium. pip-audit: no known
                vulnerabilities. NO new third-party import (re, typing are
                stdlib; localnet is internal), so requirements and the
                Dockerfile are untouched -- no dependency drift.
                Diff grep for eval/exec/shell=True/os.system/subprocess/pickle/
                md5/sha1/verify=False/innerHTML/bare-except/assert-as-
                validation: 0 hits.
                Design points, deliberate:
                 - the remote boot id is UNTRUSTED INPUT: normalise_boot_id
                   (anchored UUID regex, bounded at 64 chars) before it is
                   compared, stored or logged. Flood, valid-id-plus-junk, and
                   valid-id-past-the-bound all normalise to ''. Tested.
                 - the stored reason for a KERNEL finding interpolates nothing
                   from the remote host -- describe_if_same_kernel returns a
                   constant. The ADDRESS reason does carry the hostname (the
                   user's own input), escHtml'd like every other value, with a
                   browser test asserting <img src=x id=pwn> renders as text.
                 - unknown never refuses, in BOTH directions: empty remote
                   value, and empty own value. Two empty strings must not
                   compare equal and refuse every target in existence; there
                   is a test named for that.
                 - _record_self_target cannot turn a refusal into a 500.
                 - ONE refusal builder, because app.js keys the blocking alert
                   off detail.code; a hand-phrased second refusal would be the
                   one that renders as a bare error.
                KNOWN LIMIT, stated not hidden: a target that LIES about its
                boot id defeats the kernel check. Not meaningful here -- the
                threat model is an operator pointing this at their own box by
                mistake, not an adversarial target -- and the address checks
                still sit underneath.
                FOUND AND FIXED DURING THIS GATE, not deferred: address-level
                findings at capture start were refused but NOT recorded, so
                the server list would not have explained them -- half of what
                the user asked for. start_capture now records before refusing.
                Also found: a flagged row could have been a dead end, so the
                recovery path was checked and is real (Test connection /
                Check prerequisites re-derive and clear) -- documented in
                architecture.md and pinned by a test.
                Quality: run_tcpdump's check sits inside the existing
                try/except so a refused connection is closed, not leaked
                (asserted). No nesting over 3 levels, no duplicated logic; the
                list flag reuses .server-warn rather than inventing a layout.
📄 DOCS       ✅ CHANGELOG dev.35 (Security/Fixed/Documentation). security.md,
                target-hosts.md, architecture.md rewritten around the two
                layers, with a table of where each check runs and the
                recovery path. README "Add the server" step says it must be a
                different machine. Stale-claim sweep for "cannot be
                detected"/"looks like any other target": the only hit is
                localnet.py's own docstring, correctly scoped to "no ADDRESS
                check" with the boot-id paragraph directly under it. app.js's
                standing warning no longer claims the LAN address is
                invisible, because it is not.
📦 RELEASE    ✅ branch synced before staging (git fetch; 0 ahead, 0 behind).
                PR ➖ N/A -- no PRs until 1.0, branch canonical (memory
                release-process; user 2026-09-15), as dev.27-34.
                Commit 2916f09, approved by the user ("commit and push") and
                executed by Claude at their explicit instruction rather than
                presented, as dev.34. 21 files, +1156/-70; staged list reviewed
                before commit (no keys, no .env, no capture data). Pushed;
                ls-remote -> 2916f09.
                Git identity was already set this time (the user's repo-scoped
                config from dev.34 survived), so no repeat of that failure.
                CI on the branch push: Check 34983013960 success (8m13s), Lint
                workflows 34983013974 success (8s). Both correct on a branch
                push -- lint fires because .github/workflows/** changed.
                Release notes drafted and shown; awaiting approval.
🚀 SHIP       ✅ SHIPPED 2026-09-15. Tag block handed to the user and run by
                them; never executed here (SKILL.md 5.8). Four post-ship
                checks, all verified:
                 * tag v0.1.0-dev.35 on the remote -> 2916f09, the same commit
                   branch Check passed on.
                 * Release run 34984099369 success (1m17s). GitHub release
                   v0.1.0-dev.35 (Dev), prerelease, published
                   2026-09-15T14:49:19Z. Approved notes applied with
                   gh release edit (2653 chars, replacing release.yml's auto
                   compare link).
                 * PR ➖ N/A -- no PRs before 1.0.
                 * Artifact is the image, not a release asset (0 assets is
                   correct here): ghcr :0.1.0-dev.35 and :dev share one real
                   digest sha256:fd6f20215301aac770252e2673116177523872c95b70
                   66636fcd0a9f57c0a41f. Cross-check: :0.1.0-dev.34 still
                   reads sha256:00738f77... exactly as this file recorded it
                   last session, so the digest lookup is sound.
                   NOTE for next time: `gh api /user/packages/...` returns 403
                   (token lacks read:packages). The digests above came from
                   the anonymous registry API instead -- get a pull token from
                   ghcr.io/token?scope=repository:<owner>/<repo>:pull, then
                   HEAD the manifest with an OCI/Docker Accept header and read
                   docker-content-digest. No extra scope needed.
                 * THE CI FIX IS PROVEN, and tag time was the only place it
                   could be: the v0.1.0-dev.35 tag push fired Release ONLY.
                   dev.34's tag push fired Release AND Lint workflows (run
                   34977747554 on ref v0.1.0-dev.34) -- both still visible in
                   gh run list, side by side.
                RELEASE SEQUENCE 0.1.0-dev.35 CLOSED AND SHIPPED.

## Uncommitted at close: this file's dev.35 ship record
Same as every prior release -- the ship record cannot be inside the commit it
describes. It gets swept into the next release's commit, as dev.34's was into
2916f09.

## Session opened 2026-09-15 (local CLI, Debian 13, zsh, dev-skills 2.18.0)
Re-derived from evidence (SKILL.md S2), not trusted from the prior entry below.

HEAD = 440f5f9, up to date with origin/claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf. 7 commits
sit on the branch past the v0.1.0-dev.33 tag (6121629..440f5f9, CI-trigger fix +
actionlint + dev-build docs/compose fixes) -- all CI plumbing/docs, no
APP_VERSION bump, no source-code behavior change. Check runs green on the two
most recent (34894226882, 34894777083).

v0.1.0-dev.33: tag on remote -> c3e43f6, GitHub release published (prerelease,
2026-09-14T17:01:10Z). APP_VERSION still reads 0.1.0-dev.33, matching its own
tag exactly -- no unshipped bump, no unfinished Gate 6. CLOSED AND SHIPPED,
confirmed again this session.

## 0.1.0-dev.34 — arrangeable packet-list columns (opened 2026-09-15)
Track: RELEASE SEQUENCE 0.1.0-dev.34, chosen by the user via AskUserQuestion
after being offered work-commit and review-first instead. Sweeps up the 7
CI/docs commits already sitting past the v0.1.0-dev.33 tag.

User's ask: "the view pane's column needs to be able to add and remove other
vakues as well as be moveable". Three scoping questions put to the user, all
answered with the recommended option: (1) curated presets PLUS any tshark
field validated against tshark's own registry; (2) stored per user and applied
to every capture, server-side, Wireshark-preference style -- not per saved
view, not localStorage; (3) inline (drag headings, right-click, Apply as
Column) PLUS a preferences dialog.

Model: Opus 5, above the Sonnet ceiling. The user set it deliberately with
/model immediately before the request; flagged in the first reply and treated
as approval for this task, consistent with the dev.31/32/33 approvals below.

Implementation DONE (uncommitted):
- models.py: BUILTIN_PACKET_COLUMNS, DEFAULT_PACKET_COLUMNS,
  CUSTOM_COLUMN_PREFIX, MAX_PACKET_COLUMNS, PACKET_FIELD_RE, PacketColumn
  (model_validator ties a custom column's id to its own field so the same
  field cannot become two columns), ColumnLayout. PacketSummary.values.
- packet_parser.py: get_packet_list(extra_fields=...) appends one -e per added
  column AFTER the MAC fields and reads their values from the END of the row
  (the Info column is free text mid-row; a tab in one shifts every forward
  position -- the built-ins still read forward, unchanged).
  validate_column_fields (pattern + cap + dedupe), unknown_packet_fields +
  _lookup_in_registry (streamed `tshark -G fields`, early break, kill rather
  than drain, positives-only memo bounded at 2000).
- database.py: column_layouts table (user_id PRIMARY KEY, columns JSON),
  get/set/clear. No row = default, deliberately, so a later change to the
  default reaches everyone who never customised.
- main.py: GET/PUT/DELETE /api/column-layout + /api/column-layout/default;
  packets route gains `columns`, re-validated per request.
- frontend: thead built by renderColumnHeaders from the layout; packetCellHtml
  per column id; drag/right-click headings; Columns dialog; Apply as Column on
  the detail menu; optimistic apply with rollback when the server refuses.

SECURITY notes made during the build, before any gate ran: a field name lands
in tshark's argv as `-e <name>`, so PACKET_FIELD_RE refuses anything that
could read as a flag (`-r` being the one that matters), applied at the model,
at the save route AND on every packet list -- the list's query string is the
caller's, not necessarily the saved layout's. Added-column values are escHtml'd
like every other capture-derived value.

BUG FOUND AND FIXED during self-review, pre-gate: an explicitly added MAC
column rendered empty, because the server keys the MAC fields off the -e view
flag and the chip was not lit. packetColumns now sends -e when the layout
needs it, without lighting the chip.

🚫 BLOCKED ON THE HOST, NOT ON THE CODE: this Debian 13 box has no
python3.13-venv (so scripts/check.sh cannot even build .venv), no tshark, no
tcpdump, no capinfos. Every prior entry below was written on a Fedora box that
had them. Install asked of the user:
  sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y python3.13-venv tshark tcpdump
Until then Gate 2 cannot run and the tshark-dependent tests report SKIPPED.

FINDING FOR THE USER, not changed unilaterally: docker-compose.yml at HEAD has
a DUPLICATE top-level `secrets:` key (commit 789dae9) -- the first names
/opt/docker/pcapserver/secrets/master.key, the second ./secrets/master.key.
Last key wins in a permissive parser, so the absolute path is silently
discarded; a strict one errors outright. The same commit hardcodes one
machine's /opt/docker/pcapserver paths into the file the README tells everyone
to curl at the tag, while the Quick start still says every relative path
resolves against the install directory. Raised, awaiting the user's decision.

🔢 VERSION    ✅ 0.1.0-dev.34 in all seven refs: backend/main.py:99,
                docker-compose.yml:100, README.md:230/331/347,
                docs/reverse-proxy.md:117/372. Historical mentions in
                architecture.md:108 and database.py:248 left as history, as
                dev.33 did. REPO_URL + release_notes_url (derived from
                APP_VERSION) present. v0.1.0-dev.33 confirmed on the remote
                (ls-remote -> c3e43f6), so the previous release did ship.
🔨 BUILD      ✅ ./scripts/check.sh: 1424 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, exit 0,
                211s. First run on this box with nothing skipped -- tshark
                4.4.18, tcpdump, capinfos and playwright's chromium all
                present (dev.33's baseline was 1371; +53 are this feature's).
                New suites all green: test_columns_ui 9, test_column_layout
                21, test_packet_parser 44. Browser suites drive the real app
                via backend.serve, so the golden path is exercised.
                CONTAINER: docker needs sudo in this session (the user added
                the group but it cannot reach an already-running shell), so
                the build+smoke ran as a one-line script the user pasted,
                writing to scratchpad/smoke.log for me to read. Results:
                image localhost/pcap-server:0.1.0-dev.34 builds; / and
                /js/app.js serve 200 with the new column code in the served
                bundle (8 matches); GET /api/column-layout and
                /api/column-layout/default 401 unauthenticated, PUT 403 --
                the plain-HTTP write refusal, so the write route is behind
                that policy too, not just auth; tshark in the image is
                4.4.18, the same build as the host; `tshark -G fields` knows
                tcp.srcport and does not know a made-up name; and
                unknown_packet_fields, run in the image's own interpreter,
                returns exactly ['definitely.not.a.real.field'] -- the save
                path proven in the container, which is the one thing the host
                could not answer for it. 0 tracebacks.
                FIRST SMOKE RUN FAILED, and the fault was the harness, not
                the app: the script let Docker create the bind-mount sources
                (root-owned, so appuser could not open the database) and did
                not set DATA_DIR/CAPTURES_DIR/SSH_KEYS_DIR, which is exactly
                what entrypoint.sh keys its chown off -- compose always sets
                them. Fixed in the script. Noted, NOT changed, as
                pre-existing and out of scope: entrypoint.sh silently does
                nothing when those three are unset and its `chown ... || true`
                swallows failures, so a hand-rolled docker run fails with
                "unable to open database file" and nothing pointing at
                ownership.
                NOTE FOR NEXT TIME: two runs were wasted by changing the tree
                under a running suite -- installing chromium mid-run (browser
                fixtures raced it, E not s) and editing app.js mid-run. A
                third died because `pkill -f pytest` matched its own shell.
                Start the suite, then leave the tree alone.
🔒 SECURITY   ✅ 0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium. pip-audit: no known
                vulnerabilities. No new third-party import (model_validator is
                pydantic, already a dependency), so requirements and the
                Dockerfile are untouched -- no dependency drift.
                Diff grep for eval/exec/shell=True/os.system/pickle/md5/sha1/
                bare-except/assert-as-validation/verify=False: the only hits
                are asserts inside tests (correct usage) and one
                create_subprocess_exec, which takes an argv list and no shell.
                Design point, not an afterthought: a column's field name lands
                in tshark's argv as `-e <name>`, so PACKET_FIELD_RE refuses
                anything that could read as a flag (`-r` being the one that
                matters) at the model, at the save route, AND on every packet
                list -- the list's query string is the caller's, not
                necessarily the saved layout's. test_main.py proves the
                capture is never even looked up first.
                FIXED DURING THIS GATE'S REVIEW, not deferred:
                 - prototype lookup: `values[field]` for a field named
                   __proto__ returned Object.prototype. Now
                   hasOwnProperty-guarded. The server refuses such a name, but
                   the table draws optimistically before that answer lands.
                 - the registry memo was unbounded -> capped at 2000, and only
                   positives are cached, so a name that was wrong once is
                   re-asked rather than pinned wrong past an image rebuild.
                 - `tshark -G fields` subprocess is killed rather than left
                   with a full pipe when the scan breaks early on a match
                   (the same finding this repo already had at dev.31).
                Quality: renderColumnDialogRows was ~55 lines building a row
                inline -> split into columnDialogRow(col, index, count). One
                renderer draws headings and cells together, so the two cannot
                drift. Added columns share one CSS width class rather than
                inventing a width per field.
📄 DOCS       ✅ CHANGELOG dev.34 (Added/Changed/Documentation), covering this
                feature AND the 7 CI/compose commits it sweeps up. README:
                "Choosing the columns", Apply as Column in the two-filters
                section. architecture.md: "The column layout" (storage, the
                no-row-means-default decision, why added fields go last in
                argv and are read from the end of the row, the argv boundary,
                the registry check) + the MAC-column paragraph updated for
                layouts.
                COMPOSE FIX, on the user's "keep mine": the duplicate
                top-level `secrets:` key introduced by 789dae9 is gone and the
                absolute /opt/docker/pcapserver paths are the shipped default.
                Three docs still named the old /opt/docker/pcap install dir
                (README Quick start + Upgrading, operating.md x2) and now
                match; the compose file says outright that its paths are
                absolute rather than relative to wherever it sits.

                checks, all verified:

                   e3b0c442.
                Check did NOT run on the tag push: only Lint workflows and
                Release did, so 6121629 works as designed.
                RELEASE SEQUENCE 0.1.0-dev.34 CLOSED AND SHIPPED.

## Known defect, found at ship time, NOT fixed in dev.34 -- for dev.35
lint-workflows.yml (added by 61e63fd, this release) has a bare `on: push:`
with only a `paths:` filter and NO `branches:` filter, so it fires on TAG
pushes too -- the exact bug 6121629 fixed for check.yml in this same release.
The user spotted it on the dev.34 tag push ("still dual workflows. are they
doing the same thing"): Release and Lint workflows both ran.

Harmless in effect -- actionlint, ~11s, reads the repo and publishes nothing
-- but it is the same class of bug, and the dev.34 changelog line about CI no
longer running twice on a release is narrower than it reads.

Deliberately NOT fixed mid-release: the tag was already pushed and Release #34
in flight, so a fix could not have been in the tag anyway. Fix in dev.35:
    on:
      push:
        branches: ['**']
        paths: ['.github/workflows/**']
Same reasoning as check.yml's comment. Check pull_request: needs no change.

## Session opened 2026-09-14 (local CLI, Debian 13, zsh, dev-skills 2.18.0)
Skill was NOT installed at session start -- no SKILL.md anywhere on this box,
only this state file survived. User supplied the v2.18.0 bundle as a GitHub
release asset; installed to ~/.claude/skills/dev-skills/ (6 md files,
documentation only, no scripts/executables in the archive). It is not in this
session's registered skill list -- skills register at session start -- so it was
loaded by reading SKILL.md + GATE_REFERENCE.md directly. A restart picks it up
as a real skill.

ENVIRONMENT CHANGED from every prior entry below: those all say Fedora 44 +
bash; this machine is Debian 13 + zsh. Treat older shell/path notes as stale.

STATE RE-DERIVED from evidence (SKILL.md S2), not trusted from this file.
What this file claimed vs what is actually true:
 - claimed actionlint "NOT committed yet -- presented, awaiting approval";
   it is in fact commit 61e63fd.
 - claimed dev.33 was "two commits, neither pushed/tagged"; v0.1.0-dev.33 IS
   on the remote at c3e43f6 and is an ancestor of origin's head.
   dev.33 CLOSED AND SHIPPED.
 - git ls-remote --tags: all versions tagged through v0.1.0-dev.33.
   No unfinished Gate 6.

Branch at open: local ec2acb7, origin 440f5f9 -- 0 ahead, 3 behind. Incoming
commits are the user's own from another machine (789dae9 volume paths/secrets,
2db7df8 README compose instructions, 440f5f9 compose filename); they touch only
README.md and docker-compose.yml. Clean fast-forward; sync block presented, not
executed (local session, SKILL.md S5.8).

7 commits now sit past the v0.1.0-dev.33 tag while APP_VERSION is still
0.1.0-dev.33. Not a gate violation -- unreleased work -- but Gate 1 hard-blocks
until it is bumped, so the next release is dev.34.

Model: Opus 5, above the Sonnet ceiling. User approved staying on it for THIS
task (2026-09-14), consistent with the dev.31/dev.32 approvals below.

Notes: hooks/gate-preflight.sh is NOT installed here (.claude/hooks carries only
session-start.sh), so the prose pre-flight is the only enforcement. This file is
tracked in git rather than gitignored, contrary to SKILL.md's local-session
default -- left as the repo has always had it, not changed unilaterally.

No files modified yet this session. All six gates pending.

## CI: actionlint added, workflow-file pushes skip the full suite (2026-09-14)
Chain: user kept pressing on "why the full suite for a workflow YAML edit"
across several turns, ending in "what is the standard" (answer: actionlint,
a purpose-built static linter for Actions workflows) then "yes" to adding it.

NOT committed yet -- presented, awaiting approval.

New file .github/workflows/lint-workflows.yml: downloads actionlint v1.7.12
from its GitHub release, SHA256-checksum verified against the value in the
release's own *_checksums.txt (fetched and compared directly, not trusted
from memory -- `gh api repos/rhysd/actionlint/releases/tags/v1.7.12` for the
asset list, `curl` the checksums file, `sha256sum -c` against the real
download). Ran the resulting binary against this repo's actual check.yml and
release.yml before writing anything: 0 findings, confirming both that the
tool works and that the existing files are already clean. Triggered only on
`.github/workflows/**` -- NOT the same download-and-pipe-to-tar script
actionlint's own README advertises for CI use, which does no checksum
verification at all; downloading+verifying directly matches this repo's own
fetch_lego.py pattern instead.

check.yml: `.github/workflows/**` moved from "deliberately excluded" (my own
prior reasoning, this same file, a few commits back) into paths-ignore, now
that lint-workflows.yml gives it real coverage. Flagged explicitly to the
user, not silently assumed equivalent: actionlint is static analysis, not
execution -- it would NOT catch a typo'd script path in the "Run tests" step,
only YAML/expression-level mistakes. User has not yet responded to that
caveat or to the dependabot gap also raised (github-actions ecosystem not
watched at all, dependabot.yml only has `docker`) -- offered, not added.

Track: work commit (no APP_VERSION bump). Required: SECURITY + approval.

🔒 SECURITY  ✅ actionlint fetched over HTTPS from GitHub's own release CDN,
               checksum-verified before extraction, exact version pinned
               (manually bumped, matching LEGO_VERSION's existing pattern in
               this repo -- not a new maintenance burden shape). New job
               declares `permissions: contents: read` explicitly (checkout
               only, nothing written) -- least privilege, and check.yml/
               release.yml were checked for what they currently declare
               before choosing this rather than copying either blindly.
📦 approval  ⬜ diff shown, not yet approved

## CI: check.yml no longer fires on a tag push (2026-09-14)
REVERSES a standing decision recorded further down this file under
"0.1.0-dev.25": "DECLINED by the user 2026-09-13, do not raise again:
...narrowing check.yml's triggers." That entry is left as-is below (historical
record of what was true then); this note is the current state. User asked
directly this session ("lets not duplicate the work in the process and fix
it") after I explained the tag push fires Check a second time (the branch
push already ran it) AND fires Release, which runs no tests at all and is not
gated on Check passing -- that second, larger finding (Release publishes to
ghcr regardless of Check's result) was NOT asked to be fixed and was not
touched; only the duplicate-Check-run trigger was.

Fix: .github/workflows/check.yml `on: push:` (bare, matched every ref
including tags) -> `on: push: branches: ['**']`. Tags carry no ref under
refs/heads, so this excludes them without needing to duplicate release.yml's
own `v*` pattern. pull_request: trigger untouched. YAML validated
(python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(...)"). No test in the suite
references this file's contents, so nothing else to update.

Track: work commit (no APP_VERSION bump, no artifact, not part of the dev.33
feature set -- CI plumbing, not app CHANGELOG material, so not added there).
Required gates: SECURITY (below) + commit approval, not the full six.

🔒 SECURITY  ✅ one-line trigger-filter change to an existing, already-trusted
               workflow file. No new action, no new permission, no new
               secret, no change to what the job does once it runs -- only
               to which pushes cause it to run at all.
📦 approval  ✅ commit 6121629, approved by user ("yes"), executed by
               Claude, NOT pushed (not asked). Applies to the NEXT tag
               push, not v0.1.0-dev.33 (already tagged/shipped under the
               old trigger -- confirmed via gh: Check #92 branch push,
               Check #93 + Release #33 both on the tag push, all success).

## 0.1.0-dev.33, second commit — the recommended parity adds (2026-09-14)
User (after the first dev.33 commit, ebe5ac4): "lets commit only and do the
reccomended adds" -- the first half approved and executed already; this is a
SEPARATE, not-yet-approved batch, same open version (never tagged), so it
amends the same CHANGELOG entry rather than opening dev.34.

Scope: the four Wireshark-parity items recommended earlier and accepted --
Follow TCP/UDP Stream, Protocol Hierarchy, Conversations/Endpoints, Copy as
filter -- plus Export packet bytes (already built and committed in the first
dev.33 commit, listed here only because its CHANGELOG bullet was written in
this batch). Declined earlier and NOT built: colorization rules, Decode As,
IO Graph, full Statistics suite.

Implementation DONE (uncommitted):
- backend/packet_parser.py: get_protocol_hierarchy, get_conversations,
  get_follow_stream -- all built from one `-T fields` tshark pass aggregated
  in Python, NOT by parsing tshark's `-z io,phs`/`-z conv,ip` text reports
  (terminal-formatted, not fixed-width, wrong thing to screen-scrape).
  Follow Stream uses `follow,<proto>,raw,<index>` specifically -- verified
  empirically against a real capture that `,hex` merges consecutive
  same-direction frames' byte offsets (cannot split back apart) while `,raw`
  keeps them as separate lines; `,ascii` was ruled out for lossiness
  (non-printable bytes become `.`, wrong for something meant to be
  byte-exact). A nonexistent stream index doesn't error in tshark (exit 0,
  "Node 0: :0") -- verified, and is what the ValueError check is keyed on.
- get_packet_list gains tcp.stream/udp.stream columns (2 more -e fields,
  column indices shifted +2 -- full existing test suite re-run after the
  shift, all still passed with no index-specific test changes needed) so a
  packet ROW's own right-click can offer Follow Stream without first opening
  the detail pane -- matches Wireshark's actual workflow. get_packet_detail
  gains the same two fields from its PDML tree via a new _find_field_anywhere
  helper (tcp.stream lives under the "tcp" layer, not "frame").
- models.py: ProtocolHierarchyNode, Conversation, ConversationEndpoint,
  FollowStreamSegment, FollowStreamResult; PacketSummary + PacketDetail gain
  tcp_stream/udp_stream: int | None.
- main.py: three new routes (protocol-hierarchy, conversations,
  stream/{protocol}/{stream}), same auth/ownership/rate-limit pattern as the
  existing packet routes (_require_readable_capture, packet_rate_limiter).
  protocol path param validated against {tcp,udp} before anything else runs.
- frontend: three new <dialog>s (Protocol Hierarchy tree, Conversations two
  tables with per-row Filter buttons, Follow Stream with per-direction
  colouring + Set as display filter), two new toolbar buttons, Follow Stream
  wired into BOTH the packet-row context menu (via new data-tcp-stream/
  data-udp-stream on <tr>) and the detail-pane context menu (via
  currentDetail.tcp_stream/udp_stream) through a shared pushFollowStreamItems
  helper. Copy as filter added to filterMenuItems (the one menu-builder every
  right-click path already shares). Export packet bytes: client-side Blob
  from the hex the detail pane already holds, no new request.
SECURITY fix applied during this pass, before it ever reached a commit:
  get_follow_stream's `assert protocol in ("tcp","udp")` replaced with an
  explicit `if not in: raise ValueError` -- asserts strip under `python -O`,
  and the value was being f-string-interpolated straight into a `-z` tshark
  argument; the route already validates first, but the function itself had
  no defense if ever called from anywhere else. Re-ran the full diff grep
  for eval/exec/shell=True/os.system/innerHTML=/pickle/md5/sha1/bare-except/
  assert-as-validation after the fix: 0 further hits.
  XSS check done deliberately: reconstructed Follow Stream text is
  attacker-influenced (raw captured bytes) and is rendered via escHtml
  before insertion, same as every other interpolated value in these three
  dialogs (protocol names, addresses, error messages) -- checked one by one,
  not assumed.
Tests: packet_parser tests build a real 8-frame pcap (TCP handshake + HTTP
  exchange + unrelated UDP packet) via tests/packet_builders.py and run
  against REAL tshark -- hierarchy nesting incl. full-frame-bytes-at-every-
  layer semantics, conversation direction split, endpoint totals, follow
  reassembly byte-for-byte both directions, nonexistent-stream ValueError,
  tcp_stream/udp_stream on both PacketDetail and PacketSummary. test_main.py:
  429-before-tshark gate + bad-protocol-400 for all three routes. Browser:
  7 new tests (test_stats_dialogs_ui.py) with window.api stubbed per-path
  (the established pattern in this suite for API-backed dialogs -- no real
  capture pipeline available to browser tests here) -- tree rendering incl.
  percentage-against-root, pairs+endpoints rendering, Filter button applies
  the right expression and closes, stream colouring by direction, Set-as-
  filter uses the right field/index, server error surfaces verbatim, AND the
  row-context-menu trigger end to end (right-click -> menu item -> dialog
  opens). Plus test_packet_export_ui.py (3, from the first dev.33 commit)
  using page.expect_download to verify actual byte-exact file output, not
  just that a click ran.
  FULL SUITE, final run after this batch: 1371 passed, 0 failed, 0
  unexpectedly skipped, run twice clean.

🔢 VERSION    ➖ N/A for this commit -- still 0.1.0-dev.33, unshipped; no

🔨 BUILD      ✅ podman build localhost/pcap-server:0.1.0-dev.33 ok (rebuilt
                after this batch). Rootless smoke test (ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_
                CAPTURES=true, SELinux :Z + 0777 tmp mounts): 0 tracebacks,
                / and /js/app.js serve 200, served app.js contains the new
                dialog/menu code (grep count 10 across protocol-hierarchy/

                DB migration still drops live_stream cleanly. All three new
                routes verified 401 unauthenticated (auth gate wired, not
                skipped) with 0 server-side tracebacks in the log.
🔒 SECURITY   ✅ 0 Critical/High/Medium. One real finding (assert-as-argv-
                validation in get_follow_stream) found and fixed during this
                same pass, described above -- not deferred.
📄 DOCS       ✅ CHANGELOG dev.33 entry extended (Added: Follow Stream,

## 0.1.0-dev.33, first commit — live streaming removed (2026-09-14)
Committed locally as ebe5ac4 (NOT pushed -- user asked to commit, not push).
See the detailed record below this line for what that commit covered.

## 0.1.0-dev.33 — opened 2026-09-14 (local CLI, Fedora 44, bash, dev-skills 2.18.0)
Track: release sequence 0.1.0-dev.33. Branch = origin cd2bda5 (tag v0.1.0-dev.32,
confirmed on remote). New session picked up capture-size-handoff.md.

Diagnosis (no code changes): user gave two same-interface (ens18) captures,
2000 packets each, 943KB vs 16.6MB. Pasted packet list from the 16.6MB one
showed repeated TCP payloads at len=32804/57920/48800 on one SSH flow --
impossible as real Ethernet frames. Root cause: TSO/GSO segmentation offload
on the target NIC (virtio-net/Proxmox), independent of live vs non-live --
tcpdump captures the kernel's pre-segmentation superframe. Not a pcap-server
bug; data content is correct, per-packet framing/size/timing is not.

User: "does this affect the actual readability/truth of the actual data" ->
answered: payload content is complete and correct, packet-level structure
(counts, sizes, timing, checksums on the coalesced frame) is not representative
of the wire.

User's scope (2026-09-14), all four accepted:
 1. "remove the feature entirely and explain in the release notes why" ->
    AskUserQuestion confirmed: LIVE STREAMING (the whole watch-as-it-records
    capability), not the GSO issue itself (which isn't a pcap-server feature).
 2. Filter in Viewer by interface when `any` is used.
 3. Every section right-clickable as a filter, Wireshark-style, in the frame
    viewer.
 4. Review tshark/wireshark for other reasonable parity gaps.

Research (general-purpose subagent, Sonnet, read-only) found #3 ALREADY FULLY
IMPLEMENTED: onDetailContextMenu/buildFieldFilter/filterMenuItems (Apply/Not/
And/Or/Prepare/Copy) on the packet-detail tree, plus row-level Conversation
filter -- confirmed by direct code read, not just the subagent's word. No work
needed there; user was not told anything was missing, was told it already
exists. Same research flagged #2 as the one real, cheap gap (col-iface has no
context-menu case though the cell's own tooltip already promises the filter),
and produced a prioritized Wireshark-parity list (D) for #4, NOT YET PRESENTED
to the user or scoped into this release -- to report next turn: Follow Stream
(highest value), interface right-click (built this session, see below),
Protocol Hierarchy, Conversations/Endpoints table, Copy as Filter, Export
Packet Bytes; explicitly recommended skipping colorization rules/Decode As/
IO Graph/full Statistics suite as disproportionate for this tool.

Implementation DONE (uncommitted):
- Live streaming removed: backend/livestream.py deleted; capture.py (_LiveCount
  progress-reporting infra KEPT -- unrelated, general to all captures, NOT
  live-stream-specific despite the name); ssh_manager.py RemoteCapture.read_at
  + _sftp slot removed; database.py live_stream column DROPPED via migration
  (SQLite supports DROP COLUMN >= 3.35; host 3.51.2, container Debian 13 --
  both qualify) + orphaned settings rows (max_live_streams, live_stream_buffer_mb,
  rate_limit_live_polls_per_min) deleted from the settings table on every
  startup (get_all_settings merges raw DB rows over DEFAULTS with no filter,
  so a customized value would otherwise persist as an unlabelled key forever);
  main.py routes/imports/rate limiter removed; models.py CaptureRequest/
  CaptureInfo.live_stream fields removed; frontend (app.js ~250 lines across
  the form, capture list, tabs, viewer, and the whole live-view polling
  module; index.html; style.css, keeping @keyframes live-pulse which
  .status-running::before still uses) fully swept, verified by exhaustive
  grep to zero remaining references.
  CAUGHT BY RUNNING TESTS, NOT BY GREP: backend/sanitizer.py imported pcap
  format constants (GLOBAL_HEADER_LEN, RECORD_HEADER_LEN, MAX_RECORD_BYTES,
  magic-byte tables) FROM livestream.py -- these are generic pcap-record-
  walking constants that happened to live there, unrelated to the live-stream
  feature itself. Moved into sanitizer.py (now sole consumer, before its
  first use at module scope -- NameError on load order was itself an early
  catch). BytesSource (PcapSource over an in-memory buffer) is genuinely
  reusable test/production infra, not live-stream-specific -- moved to
  pcapsource.py; tests/test_sanitizer.py import fixed.
- Interface filter (#2): packetRowHtml's .col-iface td gains data-ifindex/
  data-iface-name; onPacketRowContextMenu gains a col-iface branch producing
  buildFieldFilter("sll.ifindex", ifindex) through the SAME filterMenuItems
  Apply/Not/And/Or/Prepare/Copy menu every other column uses -- no new
  filter-building code. Tests added in test_interface_os_ui.py (right-click
  offers the filter; Apply sets #display-filter; no ifindex -> no ifindex
  item, though the row's own Conversation filter still offers -- test
  corrected once to reflect that pre-existing, unrelated behavior).
Tests: deleted tests/test_livestream.py, tests/browser/test_live_stream_ui.py
  (whole feature gone); trimmed the live-streaming sections out of
  test_main.py, test_capture.py (965-1371, including the "display filter over
  a running capture" tests, which exercised live_poll and are gone with it),
  test_ssh_manager.py (read_at/sftp_capture fixture); scrubbed live_stream
  fixture fields from test_capture_filter_record.py (schema fixture kept --
  it's testing bpf_filter's ADD COLUMN migration on an intentionally-legacy
  schema, live_stream there is historically accurate and my DROP COLUMN
  migration handles it fine, verified), test_interface_os_ui.py,
  test_sanitize_ui.py, test_capture_ui.py.
  FULL SUITE GREEN: 1346 passed (1207 API + 139 browser), 0 failed, 0 skipped
  reported as unexpected. Run twice, clean both times.
Docs: docs/live-streaming.md deleted. README (TOC, screenshot caption, three
  feature-description paragraphs, the whole "Streaming a capture live"
  section, the tab-dot claim now false, the Interface-column paragraph
  updated to describe right-click instead of hover-only), docs/filters.md,
  docs/operating.md (settings table), docs/security.md ("what this does not
  protect"), docs/architecture.md (module table, the whole "Streaming a
  capture live" section replaced with a "Removed" note explaining the dev.33
  decision and the real GRO/TSO cause, runtime settings table, Known limits
  gains a GRO/TSO-inflated-capture entry replacing the live-stream entries).
  CHANGELOG.md dev.33 entry written (Removed/Added/Documentation).
Version: 0.1.0-dev.33 in all seven refs (verified by grep after sed):
  backend/main.py, docker-compose.yml, README.md (x3), docs/reverse-proxy.md
  (x2). v0.1.0-dev.32 confirmed on remote (ls-remote).

Not yet done: formal Gate 3 security review (a self-review during
implementation found nothing -- no new routes, no new deps, the one new
filter-string path reuses existing buildFieldFilter/escHtml hardening, the
DB migration is a static DROP COLUMN + static-key DELETE with no
interpolation -- but this is not a substitute for running the gate itself).
Podman image not yet built (Gate 2 needs this, not just local pytest).
Commit approval not requested. Parity list (D) not yet put to the user.

## 0.1.0-dev.32 — opened 2026-09-14 (local CLI, Fedora 44, bash, dev-skills 2.18.0)
Track: release sequence 0.1.0-dev.32. Branch = origin 1478ff5 (tag v0.1.0-dev.31).
2026-09-14: user pushed README gallery 83d7783 + bc07bbc; 83d7783 carried sensitive
images. User: "I dont want the images from 83d7783 in the history". Rebuilt locally
as ONE commit 5e93b75 (tree == bc07bbc, parent 1478ff5, user as author); dev.32 work
reapplied uncommitted on top. Force push (with lease on bc07bbc) handed to the user.
User force-pushed 2026-09-14: ls-remote = 5e93b75; 83d7783 not in remote branch history.
Model: Opus 5 — user approved staying on it for dev.32 only.
Scope (user 2026-09-14):
 1. Prereq check offers file capabilities on sudo hosts (sudo-ok row gets an
    optional drop-sudo fix; caps set + sudo ticked -> suggest unticking; sudo
    hint in the server form mentions caps; upgrades drop caps note).
    User choice: GROUP-RESTRICTED setcap (pcap group, chgrp, chmod 750, setcap).
 2. OS distro (PRETTY_NAME) persisted on prereq check (os_name column, cleared
    on host edit), shown in details facts AND sidebar (user choice).
 4. ADDED (user 2026-09-14): interface names for "any" captures -- record host
    ifindex->name table at capture start, Interface column in the Viewer.
 3. Question answered, no change: interface picker = live SSH ls /sys/class/net
    on every loadInterfaces (page load, server dropdown change, loadServers,
    Capture from this server); no cache.

Implementation DONE (uncommitted): ssh_manager (probe NOEXEC/TDMODE, privilege
order sudo-first when ticked, info rows, _setcap_remedy group-limited,
interface_indexes + parse_interface_indexes), capture.py _record_interface_names
(start task + end in _collect), captures.interface_names + active_servers.os_name
migrations, prereq route persists OS (complete probes only), packet_parser
sll.ifindex/pkttype, PacketSummary interface/ifindex/direction, UI: OS in sidebar
+ facts, info status, Interface column, sudo hint, .prereq-row>div min-width fix.
Tests: test_ssh_manager (+caps/ifindex, real sh probe), test_packet_parser (SLL2),
test_servers (os), test_capture (names), browser/test_interface_os_ui.

                ifindex parsed once, getcap-hint "setcap works without it" was false.
                FINDING for user (not changed): cap_net_admin unnecessary -- cap_net_raw
                alone captured any + named iface (promisc) in-image; NET_ADMIN in file
                caps makes tcpdump unexecutable where the bounding set lacks it (EPERM
                seen in default rootless podman). User referenced net_admin+net_raw.

## 0.1.0-dev.31 (previous)

## Current session — opened 2026-09-13 (local CLI, Fedora 44, bash, dev-skills 2.18.0)
Track: release sequence 0.1.0-dev.31 — packet sanitizer. IMPLEMENTATION DONE
(uncommitted), gates not yet run. Version not bumped.
New: backend/anonymize.py (Crypto-PAn, matches 10 reference vectors; MAC; names),
backend/framewalk.py (header walker + RFC 1624 checksums), backend/sanitizer.py
(tshark JSON pass in lockstep, field rules, keys, install secret data/sanitize.key),
main.py GET /api/captures/{id}/sanitize (+ /sanitize/summary?ticket=),
vault.derived_key + crypto.derive_subkey, packet_parser spawn_tool/reap_tool
(stream_filtered_pcap refactored onto them). UI: Sanitize on capture card + viewer
toolbar, <dialog> options -> report stage. Tests: test_anonymize, test_framewalk,
test_sanitizer (real tshark + routes), browser/test_sanitize_ui, packet_builders.
Docs: README What it does + "Sanitizing a capture" + TOC, roadmap item removed;
architecture.md section/modules/storage/limits/roadmap; security.md paragraph.
Findings fixed during build: tshark skips retransmitted segments' payloads
(prefs added); -J misses nested NTLMSSP (dropped); line-by-line JSON read was
3/4 of runtime (chunked split: 50k fully-selected frames 38s -> 9.4s).
check.sh on final code: 1370 passed, exit 0 (was 1267 at dev.30).
Screenshots dark/light 1440/400 checked; dialog centring + button width fixed.
NOT YET VERIFIED: container tshark (Debian, 4.4.x) runs the sanitize pass --
do this in Gate 2 with a real sanitize inside the podman image.
Branch claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf = origin 212936f (fetched at session start).
All versions tagged on the remote through v0.1.0-dev.30.
Model: Opus 5 — user approved staying on it for the sanitizer (2026-09-13).
Decisions: defaults creds+IPs+MACs; mapping key = HKDF(capture DEK), plaintext
captures fall back to one random secret file in the data volume.
Uncommitted at start: this file (dev.30 ship record); untracked
.claude/audit-handoff.md, .claude/sanitizer-handoff.md.

## 0.1.0-dev.30 tracker (previous session)
Track: 0.1.0-dev.30 CLOSED AND SHIPPED 2026-09-13 (UI refresh, HTTPS docs). Ship record uncommitted.
User decisions 2026-09-13: scope "Visual + flow"; stay on Opus 5 for this task only.
 Branch claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf = origin 8832614.
Next version would be 0.1.0-dev.30. All prior versions tagged (dev.25..dev.29).
Implementation DONE (uncommitted), gates not yet run: index.html (servers welcome,
usernames in sidebar, capture card/limits/footer, captures heading, flags explainer
after list), app.js (server dots/count/facts detail, captureFromServer, SERVERS_WELCOME,
capture stats chips/short id/error block, formatBytes, captureDuration, compact
self-capture warning, add-form clears selection), style.css (btn focus/quiet danger,
pills, logo mark, cards, phone toolbar fix), test_live_stream_ui alignment test now
compares against #cap-interface.
Docs (user request 2026-09-13): README HTTPS section high up (callout under intro,
TOC link, ## HTTPS before Quick start: ACME recommended, proxy real cert, proxy
self-signed; Quick start step 7 Turn on HTTPS; first-capture lead-in); roadmap
Windows targets (README + architecture.md); reverse-proxy.md new "No domain: a
self-signed certificate" (openssl w/ SAN+EKU, Caddy tls internal, nginx, NPM
Custom); tls.md + operating.md pointers. Anchor check: 0 broken.
HTTP warnings (user request): sign-in banner rebuilt (head/body/fix list/guide
link), read-only bar one line + admin "Set up HTTPS" -> Admin HTTPS (verified over
LAN IP 10.0.0.56), refusal panel restyled with action; _HTTPS_REMEDY + JS
HTTPS_REMEDY shortened (ACME recommended, proxy, self-signed); "restart the
container" -> docker compose up -d everywhere. BUG FIXED: /api/auth/status
cookie_secure now _cookie_secure() (built-in HTTPS + COOKIE_SECURE=false falsely
warned); test added in test_tls_routes. Recreate-not-restart note: README,
operating.md, reverse-proxy.md, nginx-proxy-manager.md, docker-compose.yml comment.
check.sh (all changes so far): 1265 passed, 0 failed, exit 0. Not yet a gate pass
(version not bumped).
Browser screenshots dark+light, 1440 and 400px:
no horizontal overflow. check.sh before fixes: 2 failed (both fixed, re-run passed).

TLS CLI hint now mirrors wizard fields (domain/email/provider/delay/staging,
shell-quoted, never credentials) + 2 browser tests; tls.md sentence.

## PENDING WORK — read before starting a session
- NEXT FEATURE (discussed, not started): packet sanitizer. See memory
  packet-sanitizer-design for the agreed shape and user decisions.
- Prepared, approved, NOT YET RUN: exhaustive security audit + operability + pentest.
  Full plan and locked user decisions in .claude/audit-handoff.md. Read-only
  investigation, carries no gates itself. Resume with "run the audit handoff".

Version: 0.1.0-dev.28 (bumped). Previous tag v0.1.0-dev.27 confirmed on
         the remote: object b63c695, ^{} -> d70e47b.
Updated: 2026-09-13 (session: local CLI, Fedora 44, bash)
Branch: claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf — canonical. Head 39e48ee = origin.
Environment: LOCAL Claude Code CLI — Claude PRESENTS git commands, the user
        runs them (SKILL.md 5.8). Not a container.
Model: Opus 5, above the Sonnet ceiling; the user approved staying on it FOR
       dev.28 (2026-09-13).

                tls.js wizard + admin-shell markup, lego 5.4.1, no log errors.
                (Afterwards: a comment fix in lego.py + architecture.md bullet;
                TLS suites re-run 179 passed.)

### What the user hit on dev.28
- lego failed: "recursive nameservers: NS 127.0.0.11:53 returned NXDOMAIN for
  _acme-challenge.pcap.nscriven.net" after 2 min. Record WAS created via
  Cloudflare; Docker's resolver forwards to the host's LAN DNS, which answers
  for nscriven.net itself (split DNS). NPM works because certbot just sleeps.
- `docker compose exec` run outside the compose dir -> "no configuration file".
- Cloudflare showed 4 credential boxes; NPM needs only the API token.
- Asked that the plain-HTTP banner name ACME as an option (it did, third).
- Container lacks ping/curl/wget -- by design; lego doesn't need them.

### Fixes (dev.29)
1. lego --dns.resolvers default 1.1.1.1:53,8.8.8.8:53; configurable per install
   (acme.json "resolvers", UI "DNS servers that check the record", CLI
   --resolvers). IP[:port] only, max 4, no loopback/link-local. Old acme.json
   loads. Verified real lego 5.4.1 parses the flag.
2. lego errors: extract error="..." from the ERROR line, drop WARN HEADS UP,
   one hint (most specific first). Tested on the user's exact output.
3. providers.PRIMARY: cloudflare=[CF_DNS_API_TOKEN], route53, lightsail, gcloud,
   azuredns, ovh, gandiv5; others under "Other ways to authenticate".
4. Banner + _HTTPS_REMEDY: "two ways" -- built-in Let's Encrypt (ACME, DNS-01)
   first, reverse proxy second.
5. UI CLI hint says to run in the compose folder; docs give docker exec.

USER DECISIONS 2026-09-13:
- "We are not going to resolve on external resolvers." Public default reverted;
  compose `dns:` workaround withdrawn.
- User: "Proxmox npm termux. Everything else I use that has certbot in acme does
  not have this issue." All of those WAIT a fixed delay and never poll local DNS.
  -> FIX: lego --dns.propagation.wait=<delay>s (skips lego's recursive and
  authoritative checks entirely -- verified in lego source
  dns01.PropagationWait(wait, skipCheck=true)). "Wait before validation",
  default 30s like Proxmox, 5..600. The resolvers setting was REMOVED (never
  released); old acme.json "resolvers" key ignored. Real lego 5.4.1 accepts the
  flag. check.sh 1259 passed, 0 skipped.
- Corrected by the user: I asserted split DNS without evidence. Cause of the
  NXDOMAIN poll remains UNCONFIRMED; the fix does not depend on it.
- Record name _acme-challenge.pcap.<zone> is correct (RFC 8555 8.4).
- Admin panel "a mess ... too busy and confusing". USER CHOSE (AskUserQuestion):
  sidebar sections (Proxmox-like), one line + Learn more, HTTPS status first
  with setup as steps. BUILT: index.html admin-shell/nav/7 pages (Overview,
  HTTPS, Encryption, Users, SSH keys, Known hosts, Settings); app.js
  selectAdminPage (data-admin-page, NOT data-tab -- activatePanel clears
  [data-tab]), remembered page (localStorage, try/catch), Overview cards + nav
  attention dots; tls.js status-first + 3-step wizard (values survive Back/Next;
  failed request leaves wizard open). Screenshots checked desktop + 400px.
  Pre-existing, not touched: top toolbar overflows at 400px.
  check.sh 1264 passed, 0 skipped, exit 0.

## 0.1.0-dev.28 tracker

ALL SIX GATES ✅ + FOUR POST-SHIP CHECKS ✅.

🔢 VERSION    ✅ 0.1.0-dev.28 in all seven refs: backend/main.py:83,
                docker-compose.yml:92, CHANGELOG heading, README.md:130/225/241,
                docs/reverse-proxy.md:110/274. grep for dev.27 outside CHANGELOG
                history and this file: none. Previous tag v0.1.0-dev.27 on
                remote (^{} d70e47b). Release-notes link built from APP_VERSION.
                pyproject.toml is pytest config only -- no app manifest.
🔨 BUILD      ✅ ./scripts/check.sh AFTER the bump: 1214 passed, 0 skipped,
                exit 0, 3m40s. Browser suites run the real app via
                backend.serve (golden path: sign-in, capture form, viewer,
                admin). CAVEAT CARRIED TO SHIP: Docker image not built here (no
                docker socket) and CI builds it only on tag push -- the user must
                `docker compose build` (lego stage is new) BEFORE tagging.
🔒 SECURITY   ✅ 0 Critical, 0 High. User: "fix all issues" -> every Medium/Low/
                quality item below was FIXED, not accepted, except one that is a
                standing user decision:
                  FIXED High (before): AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE (credential_
                    process RCE), OCI_CONFIG_FILE (key_file path read) excluded.
                  FIXED Medium: SSRF -- backend/tls/destinations.py refuses non-
                    http(s) URLs and loopback/link-local/unspecified/multicast,
                    literal at save and resolved just before lego runs. LAN
                    allowed by design. Residual (Low, documented): DNS rebinding
                    between our lookup and lego's.
                  FIXED Medium: *_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY / INFOBLOX_SSL_VERIFY no
                    longer offered (generator SKIP_VERIFY_NAME).
                  FIXED Low: base image pinned by index digest
                    sha256:78387bc3881b8273120a12ebe6c1ab22b018ccc2c9adf565ae1ac9b536e184ea
                    (verified: body hash matches, not e3b0, amd64+arm64), both
                    stages; .github/dependabot.yml (docker, weekly, 3.12 only).
                  FIXED Low: TLS routes call manager.status via to_thread.
                  FIXED Quality: manager.status split into helpers; tls.js
                    renderTls/tlsRequestForm split into single-purpose builders.
                  NOT CHANGED (user decision 2026-09-13, reaffirmed "understood
                    on the skip"): DNS credentials may cross plain HTTP; UI warns,
                    CLI offered. Only real fixes are refusing it or loopback-only.
                pip-audit clean. check.sh after fixes: 1243 passed, 0 skipped.
📄 DOCS       ✅ CHANGELOG dev.28 entry dated 2026-09-13 (now lists the
                excluded settings); README layout table gained backend/tls,

                (tls.md endpoints + cert checks, CHANGELOG, architecture,

                wait_for_function under CSP); fixed in 8fac667 + hygiene test.
                LESSON: the user on Termux wanted a MINIMAL paste block (fetch,
                tag, push) -- long guarded scripts caused frustration.

### dev.28 scope
1. Built-in HTTPS -- backend/tls/ package (self-contained), lego 5.4.1.
2. DATA_DIR not-private startup warning (warn only).
3. Capture form: BPF example chips removed; Live stream option restyled;
   Save filter left of BPF field, hidden when empty.
4. Saved display filters: table custom_display_filters, /api/display-filters,
   Save filter button left of the Viewer's display filter, listed as "Your
   filters" at top of Filter help.

USER DECISIONS (2026-09-13):
- Passphrase mode + built-in TLS: REFUSE. File/env keys allowed.
- ACME setup allowed over plain HTTP, admin-only, plus a CLI path.
- memfd, not tmpfs -> docker-compose.yml unchanged.
- lego (not certbot), Proxmox-style provider picker, ~216 providers.
- "Self-contained" = all from web UI + no extra runtime + isolated package.
  HTTP-01 NOT wanted.
- Port: HTTPS on whatever host port compose publishes (container stays 8080).
- Stay on Opus for dev.28.

DESIGN (mine, surfaced):
- Provider allowlist generated from lego source TOML (scripts/gen_lego_providers.py)
  -> backend/tls/lego_providers.json; test pins its version to Dockerfile ARG.
  Excluded: exec, manual, acmedns. No LEGO_*, no *_FILE; path-type vars are
  "file" kind: admin pastes contents, app writes into /dev/shm scratch.
- lego runs with env = PATH/HOME/LANG + validated provider vars only; cwd =
  fresh /dev/shm dir (lego auto-loads .lego.yml from cwd).
- Credentials merge: blank keeps stored value for same provider; new provider
  starts empty.
- lego fetched in a Docker build stage via backend/tls/fetch_lego.py, SHA-256
  pinned for amd64 + arm64.

VERIFIED: real lego 5.4.1 parsed our exact argv (reached ACME directory fetch
against a closed local port). Real certbot was verified earlier but is gone.
NOT VERIFIED: image build; a real issuance end to end (needs user's domain).

## 0.1.0-dev.27 tracker

🔢 VERSION    ✅ 0.1.0-dev.27 in SEVEN places now, not five.
                ⚠️ TWO NEW REFS THIS RELEASE: docs/reverse-proxy.md carries the
                image tag TWICE (the Caddy sidecar compose and the NPM sidecar
                compose). Full list: backend/main.py:80, docker-compose.yml:92,
                CHANGELOG heading, README.md:127 (Quick start curl),
                README.md:222 (version table), README.md:238 (Upgrading curl),
                docs/reverse-proxy.md:105 and :269.
                Check: grep -rn "0\.1\.0-dev\.26" excluding .git, .venv and
                CHANGELOG. A bump that misses the docs ones ships sidecar
                examples pinned to the previous image.
🔨 BUILD      ✅ ./scripts/check.sh locally: 1063 passed, 0 failed, 0 SKIPPED,
                3m16s, exit 0. dev.26 baseline was 1055; +8 = the live-control
                and Admin-placement tests.
🔒 SECURITY   ✅ 0 Critical, 0 High. pip-audit: "No known vulnerabilities
                found" -- PYSEC-2026-1845 is CLOSED this release, not deferred
                again (see below).
📄 DOCS       ✅ CHANGELOG entry for dev.27; docs/reverse-proxy.md and
                docs/Caddyfile.example new; nginx-proxy-manager.md rewritten;
                architecture.md and security.md carry the directory-permissions
                fact; compose header rewritten.
📦 RELEASE    ✅ commit d70e47b, pushed to origin and VERIFIED by ls-remote:
                refs/heads/claude/admiring-wright-k20ptf = d70e47b = local
                HEAD, 0 unpushed. 21 files.
                EXECUTED BY CLAUDE, not presented -- the user was away from
                their desk and explicitly asked ("I want you to do the the
                commit and push"). That overrides SKILL.md 5.8's presentation
                DEFAULT for a local session; it does not touch the tag rule.
                ➖ PR — N/A: no PR workflow in this repo, `git log --merges` is
                empty across its whole history.
🚀 SHIP       ✅ tagged and published by the USER, verified from the remote:
                  * tag object b63c695; refs/tags/v0.1.0-dev.27^{} -> d70e47b,
                    which EQUALS the branch head. Both halves checked -- the
                    tag object sha is not the commit sha.
                  * Release workflow 34773044743 completed/success. "Build and
                    push image" and "Create GitHub Release" both green.
                  * GitHub Release v0.1.0-dev.27 (Dev) exists, prerelease,
                    published 2026-09-13T17:56:27Z.
                  * CI fired the expected THREE runs again: Check on the branch
                    push (success), then Check + Release on the tag push. Known
                    and declined -- see the standing constraints.

                  * BOTH IMAGE TAGS RESOLVE TO ONE MANIFEST. Run by the user
                    on their docker host (this sandbox cannot -- DNS for
                    pkg-containers.githubusercontent.com does not resolve, and
                    the gh token lacks read:packages):
                      :0.1.0-dev.27 -> 14974fbb4de5467ce7dbd9a2971cdbb1f7af3ae9
                      :dev          -> same
                    ALL FOUR POST-SHIP CHECKS DONE.

                ⚠️ TRAP WORTH REMEMBERING for the next release. Piping a FAILED
                `docker manifest inspect` into sha256sum yields
                e3b0c44298fc1c14... for every tag -- that is the hash of an
                EMPTY STRING. It looks exactly like a clean match and means the
                command produced no output. Check the hash is not e3b0c442
                before believing a digest comparison.

## 0.1.0-dev.27 — what changed

1. setLiveControls(live) gates .live-bar-actions. The live bar still shows on a
   saved live-streamed capture; its BUTTONS do not. Called from startLiveView
   (true), viewCapture's stored path (false), and settleFinishedCapture (false,
   BEFORE the completed/failed branch so a FAILED capture loses them too).
   Hidden not disabled: on a finished capture there is no "why" for a disabled
   button to invite. Reported by the user testing dev.26.
2. Admin is a TOOLBAR BUTTON (#admin-tab, .btn, data-tab="admin"), not a tab.
   activatePanel selects on `[data-tab], .tab`; initTabs attaches a direct
   listener because .tab-bar delegation cannot reach outside the bar.
   THREE test files referenced `.tab[data-tab='admin']` -> now `#admin-tab`.
3. docs/reverse-proxy.md + docs/Caddyfile.example, and the NPM guide rewritten
   for a SHARED, PRE-EXISTING NPM rather than one stood up for this app.
4. chmod 0700 in the Quick start and the compose header.
5. pytest 8.3.4 -> 9.0.3 AND pytest-asyncio 0.25.2 -> 1.4.0.

### SECURITY — 0.1.0-dev.27

- NO new routes, NO new database columns, NO schema change, NO new runtime
  dependency. The app's attack surface is unchanged by this release.
- The two code changes are both frontend visibility logic. setLiveControls
  toggles one element's `hidden`; the Admin move changes which element carries
  a class. Neither touches auth, capture data, or any request.
- THE ONE REAL SECURITY CONTENT IS DOCUMENTATION, and it is a live finding:
  the entrypoint chowns ssh-keys/, data/ and captures/ to appuser but sets NO
  MODE, so at a default umask they are world-readable. data/ holds the SQLite
  database, which stores totp_secret AS PLAIN TEXT (database.py:264 writes the
  raw secret; the app must compute codes from it). Any local account that can
  read that file can mint a valid second factor for every user, indefinitely.
  Password hashes are scrypt and sessions are SHA-256 digests, so those are an
  offline-cracking problem rather than an immediate one.
  Fixed for NEW installs via chmod 0700 in the Quick start + compose header,
  and written up in docs/security.md ("The data directory") and
  architecture.md. EXISTING INSTALLS ARE STILL 0755 -- see dev.28 queue.
  An earlier draft justified the chmod partly with "the encryption salt";
  that was WRONG and was corrected before commit. crypto.py:334 says outright
  the salt is not secret. The TOTP seeds are the reason.
- pip-audit clean. PYSEC-2026-1845 (pytest 8.3.4) is closed by the bump rather
  than carried. It was dev-only -- the Dockerfile installs requirements.txt --
  but an advisory nobody can close is one everybody learns to scroll past.
  pytest 9 required pytest-asyncio 1.4.0 because 0.25.2 pins pytest<9. BOTH
  SUITES were run against the pair before committing: 929 API + 134 browser,
  no failures, no new warnings. asyncio_mode="auto" and the function-scoped
  fixture loop in pyproject.toml are unchanged and still honoured.

### DECLINED this session — do not re-raise

Wiring the NPM management page into pcap-server's Admin tab. Three shapes were
considered and all refused:
  * iframe -- blocked by default-src 'self' anyway, but the real objection is
    that it trains people to type another app's credentials into a frame this
    app serves.
  * a link -- 127.0.0.1:81 resolves to the BROWSER's machine, not the host, so
    it is wrong in exactly the deployment that needs it.
  * pcap-server reverse-proxying NPM at /npm/ -- couples two trust domains (any
    pcap-server admin session becomes NPM admin), is SSRF by construction, and
    defeats the loopback bind that was the point.
The real need is answered in docs/reverse-proxy.md: SSH tunnel for setup, a
management-interface bind, or NPM behind itself with an Access List.

Also reverted this session: a `docs` URL map on /api/auth/status, added on a
MISREADING of "wire the page into the admin". backend/main.py is byte-identical
to HEAD. Do not re-add it unless asked.

## Queued for 0.1.0-dev.28

1. ACME/certbot integration. THE PLAN IS docs/acme-plan.md, committed with
   dev.27 -- read it first, it has the Termix findings and the decisions
   already taken. Headlines:
     * uvicorn terminates TLS; NO bundled nginx (we have one process).
     * SEAL THE TLS PRIVATE KEY under the master key -- the user's decision,
       2026-09-13. Termix leaves privkey.pem in plaintext on the volume; we do
       not. Implies decrypting to a tmpfs/-/run path at startup, which implies
       a compose-file change to the TAG-PINNED file people fetch.
     * DNS-01 is the documented default; a capture box is usually internal.
     * OPEN QUESTION 1: passphrase mode vs built-in TLS. A locked vault has no
       key to open at startup. Decide: loud HTTP fallback, or refuse the
       combination outright.
     * OPEN QUESTION 2, and the sharpest one: you configure ACME while still
       on plain HTTP, which is exactly when the app is read-only. The admin
       ACME routes would have to join _INSECURE_ALLOWED_PATHS. That needs its
       own justification and probably a local-connection restriction.
     * Validate domain and email HARD. Termix does not, and both land in argv
       after -d; a value starting with `-` is argument injection into
       certbot's parser.
2. Existing installs still have 0755 on data/. A startup check that warns when
   DATA_DIR is group- or world-readable would cover the installs the Quick
   start fix cannot reach. NOT YET RAISED WITH THE USER -- offer it.



1. The Stop capture button is offered on a SAVED capture. The live bar is
   shown for any capture with live_stream set, including completed ones, so
   Stop and Follow are both live on a finished capture -- and stopLiveCapture()
   returns early with no live capture id, so the button silently does nothing.
   Reported by the user after testing dev.26.
2. Move Admin off the tab bar and into the toolbar, beside the version link,
   the GitHub link and Logout. It is a destination, not a working tab.
3. Reverse-proxy setup: worked examples for Caddy, nginx AND Nginx Proxy
   Manager, written as a setup procedure rather than a config reference.
4. The NPM doc assumed you would stand NPM up FOR pcap-server, on a shared
   Docker network. Wrong: NPM is a proxy people already run, usually on
   another machine, and pcap-server is one more proxy host on it.
5. Link the author's own posts where they answer the prerequisite:
   NPM -> ramblingnonsense.nscriven.net/p/its-a-secret-to-everybody
   SSH keys -> ramblingnonsense.nscriven.net/p/stop-using-passwords-for-ssh

## 0.1.0-dev.26 — CLOSED AND SHIPPED 2026-09-13

All six gates ✅. Tag confirmed on the remote (above). What shipped:

Eight changes, from two batches the user queued in one session:

1. bpf_filter persisted on the capture record + migration; badged on the
   capture list under the FILTER_LIBRARY's own name where one exists.
2. Server, interface and capture filter shown on the viewer label.
3. Custom filter entries: custom_filters table, /api/filters CRUD, "Your
   filters" group at the top of the library, Save this filter on the form.
4. A capture name is required BY THE FORM (not by the API).
5. A pre-capture confirm dialog summarising the request.
6. OLED true-black dark theme.
7. Accent moved from teal to periwinkle blue (#6d9eff dark / #2b5fd9 light).
8. No standing Viewer tab; captures open as tabs of their own.

### SECURITY — 0.1.0-dev.26

- No new dependencies. pip-audit clean for everything in requirements.txt.
- THREE NEW ROUTES, all under /api/filters. Every one is
  Depends(get_current_user); there is no anonymous path. The mutating two are
  covered by enforce_read_only_over_http automatically -- they start with
  /api/ and are not in _INSECURE_ALLOWED_PATHS, which was checked rather than
  assumed.
- Per-user scoping is in the STATEMENT, not in a check beside it. Every
  custom_filters query carries `user_id = ?` in its own WHERE clause, so there
  is no window between an ownership check and the write. delete returns
  rowcount and the route turns 0 into a 404 -- not a 403, which would confirm
  the id exists.
- The saved expression goes through the SAME validator CaptureRequest uses
  (BPF_FORBIDDEN_CHARS). This is the point: /api/filters is a second door into
  the same argv, because a saved filter is replayed into a real capture. A
  test asserts a refused expression never reaches the database.
- The 409 body echoes the caller's OWN label back to them and nothing else. It
  reaches the DOM through textContent, never innerHTML.
- ONE new SQL migration, a hardcoded ALTER TABLE with no interpolation.
- New DOM: every interpolation in the filter badge, the viewer origin line and
  the capture tab strip goes through escHtml, including the title attributes.
  The badge title carries an operator-supplied BPF expression, which is the
  one genuinely attacker-adjacent string in the set.
- NO NEW EXPOSURE of packet data. Nothing here reads, moves or renders capture
  bytes; the filter is metadata about a capture, not its contents.

### Added after the first pass, at the user's direction

9.  README RESTRUCTURE. 1360 lines -> 598. Five subjects each became one
    document: docs/target-hosts.md, docs/filters.md, docs/live-streaming.md,
    docs/security.md, docs/operating.md. Nothing deleted -- the README keeps a
    short version of each and links the long one from a table at the top.
    A link checker over README + docs/*.md reports every internal link and
    anchor resolving; re-run it after any doc move.
10. PER-USER CAPS, both tables, in one change as the finding recommended:
    MAX_CUSTOM_FILTERS_PER_USER = 200 and MAX_VIEWS_PER_CAPTURE = 50, both in
    database.py. Enforced in add_custom_filter / add_capture_view, surfaced as
    409 with "limit" in the message.
11. MFA RESET. POST /api/admin/users/{id}/totp/reset, admin-only, plus
    backend/resetmfa.py as the host-side escape hatch.

    THE SECURITY DESIGN IS THE SPLIT, do not collapse it:
    - An admin may reset ANOTHER account over HTTP.
    - SELF-RESET IS REFUSED (400, code cannot_reset_own_totp). It cannot help
      a locked-out admin -- reaching any route means already being past the
      second factor -- and it IS a persistence path for a stolen session
      cookie: strip MFA, enrol your own authenticator, and a session that
      expires in hours becomes a login that does not.
    - The locked-out SOLE admin is answered out of band by
      `python -m backend.resetmfa <username> --apply`, at the bar of host
      access. Dry run by default. It never touches a password.

    A reset does THREE things and all three are load-bearing:
    - NULLs totp_secret, not just totp_confirmed. Otherwise whoever still
      holds the old authenticator can confirm the account straight back. This
      is also what makes /api/auth/totp/setup issue a FRESH secret, since it
      reuses a stored one if there is one.
    - delete_sessions_for_user -- a live session already carries both factors.
    - delete_trusted_devices -- a trusted device IS a second factor.
    18 tests in tests/test_mfa_reset.py cover all of it, including the refusal
    not being a partial reset and not signing the caller out.

### QUALITY — reviewed, and the one thing worth knowing
- FILTER_NAMES is derived from FILTER_LIBRARY at load rather than written out
  as a second table, so a filter cannot be offered under one name and listed
  under another. The reverse lookup is EXACT-MATCH ONLY and must stay that
  way: recognising `tcp port 443` inside a composed expression would name a
  capture after the broader half of its own filter, and working out how much
  narrower it really is means a second BPF model in the frontend.

### The migration's deliberate guess

An old capture row reads bpf_filter = '' and the UI shows no badge. The filter
IS recoverable from `command` -- it is the trailing argv -- and that is
refused on purpose: parsing it back means a second BPF parser picking an
expression out of an argv that also carries -i, -w and -s. Guessing
"unfiltered" loses a label on old captures; guessing a filter would be a false
claim about what is inside the file. test_a_capture_taken_before_the_column_
reads_as_unfiltered asserts both halves, including that the filter really is
sitting there in the command string.

## 0.1.0-dev.25 — CLOSED AND SHIPPED

All six gates ✅. Tag v0.1.0-dev.25 confirmed on the remote. The long-form
notes for dev.21–dev.25 were dropped from this file when dev.26 opened; the
CHANGELOG carries the user-facing record and git carries the rest. The
non-obvious constraints that outlive a release are below.

## Standing constraints — carry these forward

- **Version refs are FIVE places, not three.** The no-clone Quick start fetches
  docker-compose.yml from a TAG-pinned raw URL, so README.md carries release
  tags. A bump that misses them ships a Quick start pointing at the previous
  release.
- **backend/bpf.py and frontend/js/app.js (bpfCheckExpression) are one model in
  two copies**, kept honest by a parity browser test. Change both or neither.
- **page.wait_for_function needs "() => ..." here, never a bare expression.**
  CSP in this app blocks the bare form.
- **Custom filter entries are private per user. The server dropdown is closed** —
  do not touch it.
- **pyproject.toml is pytest config only** — no [project] table, so the
  repo-link requirement lands on backend/main.py REPO_URL + release_notes_url.
- **CI fires three runs per release** (check on branch push, a duplicate check on
  the tag push, and the release publish). check.yml uses bare `on: push:` and a
  tag push is a push. One-line fix OFFERED, not accepted:
  `on: push: branches: ['**']`. Do not re-raise unprompted.
- **DECLINED by the user 2026-09-13, do not raise again:** rewiring CI so
  release.yml calls check.yml as a gate (workflow_call + needs) and narrowing
  check.yml's triggers. The finding stands — a tag push publishes to ghcr
  whether or not the suite passed, and release.yml runs no tests — but local
  runs are the gate by choice.
- **Live streaming has still never run against a real remote host.** The
  untested seam is tcpdump -U's real write cadence, i.e. whether a 3s poll feels
  live. Covered by real tools: the record walk, filter behaviour against real
  tshark, and read_at against a real asyncssh SFTP server.

## Queued UI batch — the work dev.26 draws from

1. Capture list filter display: a badge on BPF-filtered captures plus readable
   protocol names. NEEDS a bpf_filter column + migration — it lives on
   CaptureRequest only today and is never persisted. THIS IS NEXT.
2. Server + BPF string shown during a live capture.
3. Custom filter entries.
4. Requiring a capture name.
5. The pre-capture confirm dialog.
