# dev-skills gate pre-flight — PreToolUse hook
#
# Blocks git write operations when the gates the operation requires have not
# passed. This is the deterministic half of gate enforcement: SKILL.md asks
# Claude to check the gates, this makes the check unskippable for anything
# Claude executes itself.
#
# Source of truth is .dev-skills-gates.md in the repo root (SKILL.md Section 2). A gate
# counts as satisfied when its line carries ✅ (passed) or ➖ (N/A).
#
# Install: see hooks/README.md
# Bypass:  DEV_SKILLS_GATE_HOOK=off
#
# Fails closed. Per SKILL.md Section 4, when something unexpected happens we
# deny rather than allow.
