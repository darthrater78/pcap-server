# --- which interpreter builds the venv ------------------------------------

# The pins decide this, not whatever `python3` happens to be. The ceiling was
# set when pydantic-core (via pydantic==2.10.3) shipped wheels only up to cp313;
# past that pip fell back to building it from source, which needed PyO3 <= 3.13
# and died with
#
#   error: the configured Python interpreter version (3.14) is newer than
#   PyO3's maximum supported version (3.13)
#
# buried in a few hundred lines of cargo output that never mentions Python
# versions at all. Fedora 44 ships 3.14 as `python3`, so this was not
# hypothetical -- the script was simply unrunnable there.
#
# pydantic 2.13.5 (dev.39) pulls a pydantic-core that does ship cp314 wheels,
# so that particular failure is gone. The ceiling stays at 3.13 until the suite
# has actually been run on 3.14 -- every other compiled pin has to install and
# pass there too, and nothing has shown that yet.
#
# 3.12 is what the Dockerfile and .github/workflows/check.yml use, so it is the
# version this project is actually exercised on, and it is tried first. The
# floor below is the oldest the code's syntax allows rather than a version
# anyone tests; the ceiling is the one carrying real evidence.
