        that account's second factor and enrol the thief's own authenticator,
        turning a session that expires in hours into a login that does not.
        Self-service MFA removal from inside a session is exactly the

    session carries both factors already, so leaving one alive would let the
    old authenticator's holder keep working for up to session_hours after the
    reset. A trusted device is a second factor in its own right -- the whole

    StaticFiles sends ETag and Last-Modified and nothing else. With no
    Cache-Control at all a browser falls back to heuristic freshness -- around
    a tenth of the file's age since Last-Modified -- and serves app.js from its
    own cache without asking us. The result is a deployment where the backend
    is the new version and the page is the old one, which from the outside is
    indistinguishable from the fix not working: a button that was repaired and
    released still does nothing, because the browser is running last release's
    script against this release's API.

    That is not hypothetical. dev.18 shipped a fix for a dead button and the
    button stayed dead for exactly this reason.

    "no-cache" means revalidate before reuse, not "do not store". The ETag is
    already being sent, so a reload costs one conditional request answered 304
    with no body -- the file is still not re-downloaded unless it changed.
