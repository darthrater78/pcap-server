"""Infrastructure for the browser suites: a real server, a real browser.

The Python suites call the API directly and cover it thoroughly. That is not
the same thing as covering the app, and the gap is not theoretical -- every one
of these shipped while the API suite was green:

  * Enter did nothing in the server form. There is no <form> on the page, so
    the browser's own submit behaviour never applied, and the keydown handler
    named five element ids that did not include any field of that form. The
    API was fine; the form had no way to submit it.
  * The inline theme script is pinned in the CSP by content hash. Editing the
    script without recomputing the hash makes the browser drop it silently --
    no error, no failed request, just the wrong theme on first paint.
  * The filter library was a tab; choosing a filter filled a field on a
    different tab.

None of those produce a bad HTTP response, so none of them can be seen from a
test that only speaks HTTP. These suites drive the page the way a person does.

These suites use playwright's async API, not its sync one. The sync API drives
the driver through an event loop it installs on the main thread and keeps for
as long as it is open; the rest of this repo's tests are async and run under
pytest-asyncio, which then finds a loop it did not make and cannot tear down.
Each suite passes on its own either way -- the two only collide in a full run,
which is the run that matters.

Skipping: if playwright or a chromium binary is missing the tests report as
SKIPPED with the remedy in the reason, the same way the tshark-dependent tests
do -- scripts/check.sh runs pytest with -r s so a skipped browser suite is
printed, not silently dropped.
