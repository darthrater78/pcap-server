"""The server list's self-target flag, drawn by the real renderer.

A server the backend has proved to be the machine pcap-server runs on is
refused for captures but stays in the list -- deleting someone's configuration
over a finding is not the backend's to do. What is under test here is that the
row says so, because an entry that simply fails every time with nothing stated
is the dead end the flag exists to prevent. Where the finding comes from is
covered in tests/test_servers.py and tests/test_localnet.py.
