"""The Capture tab, and the filter library that now lives inside it.

The library used to be a tab of its own. Choosing a filter there filled in a
field on a different tab, so the app had to switch tabs to show you what your
click had done -- and the only way to use a capture filter was to leave the
form you were filling in, find the filter, and be sent back. It sits under the
BPF field now, and that arrangement is what these tests hold in place: the
field it fills has to be the field above it.

None of this is visible from the API. There is no endpoint for the filter
library; it is a constant in app.js rendered into the page.
